when shall we three meet againe
in thunder lightning or in raine
when the hurleyburleys done
when the battailes lost and wonne
that will be ere the set of sunne
where the place
upon the heath
there to meet with macbeth
i come graymalkin
padock calls anon faire is foule and foule is faire
hover through the fogge and filthy ayre
what bloody man is that he can report
as seemeth by his plight of the revolt
the newest state
this is the serieant
who like a good and hardy souldier fought
gainst my captivity haile brave friend
say to the king the knowledge of the broyle
as thou didst leave it
doubtfull it stood
as two spent swimmers that doe cling together
and choake their art the merciless macdonwald
worthy to be a rebell for to that
the multiplying villanies of nature
doe swarme upon him from the western isles
of kernes and gallowgrosses is supplyd
and fortune on his damned quarry smiling
shewd like a rebells whore but alls too weake
for brave macbeth well hee deserves that name
disdayning fortune with his brandisht steele
which smoakd with bloody execution
like valours minion carud out his passage
till hee facd the slave
which neur shooke hands nor bad farwell to him
till he unseamd him from the nave toth chops
and fixd his head upon our battlements
o valiant cousin worthy gentleman
as whence the sunn gins his reflection
shipwracking stormes and direfull thunders
so from that spring whence comfort seemd to come
discomfort swells marke king of scotland marke
no sooner justice had with valour armd
compelld these skipping kernes to trust their heeles
but the norweyan lord surveying vantage
with furbusht armes and new supplyes of men
began a fresh assault
dismayd not this our captaines macbeth and
banquoh
yes as sparrowes eagles
or the hare the lyon
if i say sooth i must report they were
as cannons overchargd with double cracks
so they doubly redoubled stroakes upon the foe
except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
or memorize another golgotha
i cannot tell but i am faint
my gashes cry for helpe
so well thy words become thee as thy wounds
they smack of honor both goe get him surgeons
enter rosse and angus

what a haste lookes through his eyes
so should he looke that seemes to speake things strange
god save the king
whence camst thou worthy thane
from fiffe great king
where the norweyan banners flowt the sky and fann our people cold
norway himselfe with terrible numbers
assisted by that most disloyall traytor
the thane of cawdor began a dismall conflict
till that bellonas bridegroome lapt in proofe
confronted him with selfecomparisons
point against point rebellious arme gainst arme
curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
the victory fell on us
great happinesse
that now sweno the norwayes king
craves composition
nor would we deigne him buriall of his men
till he disbursed at saint colmes ynch
ten thousand dollars to our generall use
no more that thane of cawdor shall deceive
our bosome interest goe pronounce his present death
and with his former title greet macbeth
ile see it done
what he hath lost noble macbeth hath wonne

peace the charmes wound up
enter macbeth and banquo
so foule and faire a day i have not seene
how farre ist calld to soris what are these

that looke not like th inhabitants oth earth
and yet are ont live you or are you aught
that man may question you seeme to understand me
by each at once her choppy finger laying
upon her skinny lips you should be women
and yet your beards forbid me to interprete
that you are so
speake if you can what are you
all haile macbeth haile to thee thane of glamis
all haile macbeth haile to thee thane of cawdor
all haile macbeth that shalt be king hereafter
good sir why doe you start and seeme to feare
things that doe sound so faire ith name of truth
are ye fantasticall or that indeed
which outwardly ye shew my noble partner
you greet with present grace and great prediction
of noble having and of royall hope
that he seemes wrapt withall to me you speake not
if you can looke into the seedes of time
and say which graine will grow and which will not
speake then to me who neyther begge nor feare
your favors nor your hate
hayle

lesser than macbeth and greater
not so happy yet much happyer
thou shalt get kings though thou be none
so all haile macbeth and banquo
banquo and macbeth all haile
stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
by sinells death i know i am thane of glamis
but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives
a prosperous gentleman and to be king
stands not within the prospect of beleefe
no more then to be cawdor say from whence
you owe this strange intelligence or why
upon this blasted heath you stop our way
with such prophetique greeting
speake i charge you
the earth hath bubbles as the water has
and these are of them whither are they vanishd
into the ayre and what seemd corporall
melted as breath into the winde
would they had stayd
were such things here as we doe speake about
or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner
your children shall be kings
you shall be king
and thane of cawdor too went it not so
toth selfesame tune and words whos here
enter rosse and angus
the king hath happily receiud macbeth
the newes of thy success and when he reades
thy personall venture in the rebels sight
his wonders and his prayses doe contend
which should be thine or his silencd with that
in viewing ore the rest oth selfesame day
he findes thee in the stout norweyan rankes
nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make
strange images of death as thick as tale
can post with post and every one did beare
thy prayses in his kingdomes great defence
and powrd them down before him
wee are sent
to give thee from our royall master thanks
onely to harrold thee into his sight
not pay thee
and for an earnest of a greater honor
he bad me from him call thee thane of cawdor
in which addition haile most worthy thane
for it is thine
what can the devill speake trve
the thane of cawdor lives
why doe you dress me in borrowed robes
who was the thane lives yet
but under heavy judgement beares that life
which he deserves to loose
whether he was combind with those of norway
or did lyne the rebell with hidden helpe
and vantage or that with both he labourd
in his countreyes wracke i know not
but treasons capitall confessd and proud
have overthrown him
glamys and thane of cawdor
the greatest is behinde thankes for your paines
doe you not hope your children shall be kings
when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me
promisd no less to them
that trusted home
might yet enkindle you unto the crowne
besides the thane of cawdor but tis strange
and oftentimes to winn us to our harme
the instruments of darkness tell us truths
winn us with honest trifles to betrays
in deepest consequence
cousins a word i pray you
two truths are told
as happy prologves to the swelling act
of the imperiall theame i thanke you gentlemen
this supernaturall solliciting
cannot be ill cannot be good
if ill why hath it given me earnest of successe
commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor
if good why doe i yeeld to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth unfixe my heire
and make my seated heart knock at my ribbes
against the use of nature present feares
are less then horrible imaginings
my thought whose murther yet is but fantasticall
shakes so my single state of man
that function is smotherd in surmise
and nothing is but what is not
looke how our partners rapt
if chance will have me king
why chance may crown me
without my stirre
new honors come upon him
like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
but with the aid of use
come what come may
time and the houre runs through the roughest day
worthy macbeth wee stay upon your leysure
give me your favour
my dull braine was wrought with things forgotten
kinde gentlemen your paines are registred
where every day i turn the leafe
to reade them
let us toward the king thinke upon
what hath chancd and at more time
the interim having weighd it let us speake
our free hearts each to other
very gladly
till then enough
come friends
is execution done on cawdor
or not those in commission yet returnd
my liege they are not yet come back
but i have spoke with one that saw him dy who did report that very frankly hee
confessd his treasons implord your highness pardon
and set forth a deepe repentance
nothing in his life became him
like the leaving it hee dyde
as one that had beene studied in his death
to throw away the dearest thing he owd
as twere a careless trifle
theres no art
to finde the mindes construction in the face
he was a gentleman on whom i bvilt
an absolute trust
enter macbeth banquo rosse and angus
the service and the loyalty i owe
in doing it payes it selfe
your highness part is to receive our duties
and our duties are to your throne and state
children and servants which doe but what they should
by doing every thing safe toward your love
and honor
welcome hither
i have begun to plant thee and will labour
to make thee full of growing noble banquo
that hast no less deserud nor must be knowne
no less to have done so let me enfold thee
and hold thee to my heart
there if i grow
the harvest is your owne
my plenteous ioyes
wanton in fulness seeke to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow sonnes kinsmen thanes
and you whose places are the nearest know
we will establish our estate upon
our eldest malcolme whom we name hereafter
the prince of cumberland which honor must
not unaccompanied invest him onely
but signes of nobleness like starres shall shine
on all deservers from hence to envernes
and binde us further to you
the rest is labor which is not usd for you
ile be my selfe the herbenger and make ioyfull
the hearing of my wife with your approach
so humbly take my leave
my worthy cawdor
the prince of cumberland that is a step
on which i must fall down or else oreleape

which the eye feares when it is done to see
enter
trve worthy banquo he is full so valiant
and in his commendations i am fed
it is a banquet to me lets after him
whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
it is a peereless kinsman
they met me in the day of success and i have
learnd by the perfectst report they have more in them then
mortall knowledge when i burnt in desire to question them
further they made themselves ayre into which they vanishd
whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from
the king who allhaild me thane of cawdor by which title
before these weyward sisters saluted me and referrd me to
the comming on of time with haile king that shalt be this
have i thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of
greatness that thou mightst not loose the dves of reioycing
by being ignorant of what greatness is promisd thee lay
it to thy heart and farewell
glamys thou art and cawdor and shalt be
what thou art promisd yet doe i feare thy nature
it is too full oth milke of humane kindnesse
to catch the neerest way thou wouldst be great

the illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly
that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
and yet wouldst wrongly winne
thouldst have great glamys that which cryes
thus thou must doe if thou have it
and that which rather thou dost feare to doe
then wishest should be undone high thee hither
that i may powre my spirits in thine eare
and chastise with the valour of my tongve
all that impeides thee from the golden round
which fate and metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
to have thee crownd withall

we will proceed no further in this businesse
he hath honourd me of late and i have bought
golden opinions from all sorts of people
which would be worn now in their newest glosse
not cast aside so soone
was the hope drunke
wherein you drest your selfe hath it slept since
and wakes it now to looke so greene and pale
at what it did so freely from this time
such i account thy love art thou affeard
to be the same in thine own act and valour
as thou art in desire wouldst thou have that
which thou esteemst the ornament of life
and live a coward in thine own esteeme
letting i dare not wait upon i would
like the poore cat ith addage
prythee peace
i dare do all that may become a man
who dares do more is none
what beast wast then
that made you breake this enterprize to me
when you durst do it then you were a man
and to be more then what you were you would
be so much more the man nor time nor place
did then adhere and yet you would make both
they have made themselves and that their fitness now
dos unmake you i have given sucke and know
how tender tis to love the babe that milkes me
i would while it was smyling in my face
have pluckt my nipple from his boneless gummes
and dasht the braines out had i so sworne
as you have done to this
if we should faile
we faile
but screw your courage to the sticking place
and weele not fayle when duncan is asleepe
whereto the rather shall his dayes hard iourney
soundly invite him his two chamberlaines
will i with wine and wassell so convince
that memory the warder of the braine
shall be a fume and the receit of reason
a lymbeck onely when in swinish sleepe
their drenched natures lyes as in a death
what cannot you and i performe upon
th ungvarded duncan what not put upon
his spungy officers who shall beare the gvilt
of our great quell
bring forth menchildren onely
for thy undaunted mettle should compose
nothing but males will it not be receiud
when we have markd with blood those sleepy two
of his own chamber and usd their very daggers
that they have dont
who dares receive it other
as we shall make our griefes and clamor rore
upon his death
i am settled and bend up
each corporall agent to this terrible feat
away and mock the time with fairest show
false face must hide what the false heart doth know
how goes the night boy
the moone is down i have not heard the
clock
and she goes down at twelve
i taket tis later sir
hold take my sword
theres husbandry in heaven
their candles are all out take thee that too
a heavy summons lyes like lead upon me
and yet i would not sleepe
mercifull powers restraine in me the cursed thoughts
that nature gives way to in repose
enter macbeth and a servant with a torch
a friend
what sir not yet at rest the kings a bed
he hath beene in unusvall pleasure
and sent forth great largess to your offices
this diamond he greetes your wife withall
by the name of most kind hostesse
and shut up in measureless content
being unprepard
our will became the servant to defect
which else should free have wrought
alls well
i dreamt last night of the three weyward sisters
to you they have shewd some truth
i thinke not of them
yet when we can entreat an houre to serve
we would spend it in some words upon that businesse
if you would graunt the time
at your kindst leysure
if you shall cleave to my consent
when tis it shall make honor for you
so i lose none
in seeking to augment it but still keepe
my bosome franchisd and allegeance cleare
i shall be counsaild
good repose the while
thankes sir the like to you
goe bid thy mistress when my drinke is ready
she strike upon the bell get thee to bed
enter
that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
what hath quenchd them hath given me fire
hearke peace it was the owle that shriekd
the fatall bellman which gives the sternst goodnight
he is about it the doores are open
and the surfeted groomes doe mock their charge
with snores i have druggd their possets
that death and nature doe contend about them
whether they live or dye
enter macbeth
whos there what hoa

and tis not done th attempt and not the deed
confounds us hearke i layd their daggers ready
he could not misse em had he not resembled

didst thou not heare a noyse
i heard the owle schreame and the crickets cry
did not you speake
when
now
as i descended
i
hearke who lyes ith second chamber
donalbaine
this is a sorry sight
a foolish thought to say a sorry sight
theres one did laugh ins sleepe
and one cryd murther that they did wake each other
i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers
and addrest them againe to sleepe
there are two lodgd together
one cryd god bless us and amen the other
as they had seene me with these hangmans hands
listning their feare i could not say amen
when they did say god bless us
consider it not so deepely
but wherefore could not i pronounce amen
i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat
these deeds must not be thought
after these wayes so it will make us mad
me thought i heard a voyce cry sleep no more
macbeth does murther sleepe the innocent sleepe
sleepe that knits up the raveld sleeve of care
the death of each dayes life sore labors bath
balme of hurt mindes great natures second course
chiefe nourisher in lifes feast
what doe you meane
still it cryd sleepe no more to all the house
glamis hath murtherd sleepe and therefore cawdor
shall sleepe no more macbeth shall sleepe no more
who was it that thus cryd why worthy thane
you doe unbend your noble strength to thinke
so brainesickly of things goe get some water
and wash this filthy witness from your hand
why did you bring these daggers from the place
they must lye there goe carry them and smeare
the sleepy groomes with blood
ile goe no more
i am afraid to thinke what i have done
looke ont againe i dare not
infirme of purpose
give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead
are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood
that feares a painted devill if he doe bleed
ile gvild the faces of the groomes withall
for it must seeme their gvilt

whence is that knocking
how ist with me when every noyse appalls me
what hands are here hah they pluck out mine eyes

making the greene one red
enter lady
my hands are of your colour but i shame
to weare a heart so white
to know my deed
heres a knocking indeede if a man were
porter of hell gate hee should have old turning the
key
was it so late friend ere you went to bed
that you doe lye so late
faith sir we were carowsing till the second cock
and drinke sir is a great provoker of three things
what three things does drinke especially
provoke
marry sir nosepainting sleepe and urine
lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes
the desire but it takes away the performance therefore
much drinke may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it makes him and it marres him it sets him on
and it takes him off it perswades him and disheartens
him makes him stand too and not stand too in conclusion
equivocates him in a sleepe and giving him the lye
leaves him
i beleeve drinke gave thee the lye last night
that it did sir ithe very throat on me but i
requited him for his lye and i thinke being too strong
for him though he tooke up my legges sometime yet i
made a shift to cast him
enter macbeth

where we lay our chimneys were blown downe
and as they say lamentings heard ith ayre
strange schreemes of death
and prophecying with accents terrible
of dyre combustion and confusd events

your royall fathers murtherd
oh by whom
those of his chamber as it seemd had dont
their hands and faces were all badgd with blood
so were their daggers which unwipd we found
upon their pillowes they stard and were distracted
no mans life was to be trusted with them
o yet i doe repent me of my fury that i did kill them
wherefore did you so
who can be wise amazd temprate  furious
loyall and neutrall in a moment no man
th expedition of my violent love
outrun the pawser reason here lay duncan
his silver skinn lacd with his golden blood
and his gashd stabs lookd like a breach in nature
for rvines wastfull entrance there the murtherers
steepd in the colours of their trade their daggers
unmannerly breechd with gore who could refraine
that had a heart to love and in that heart
courage to makes love knowne
helpe me hence hoa
looke to the lady
why doe we hold our tongves
that most may clayme this argument for ours
what should be spoken here
where our fate hid in an augure hole
may rush and seize us lets away
our teares are not yet brewd
nor our strong sorrow
upon the foot of motion
looke to the lady
and when we have our naked frailties hid
that suffer in exposure let us meet
and question this most bloody piece of worke
to know it further feares and scruples shake us
in the great hand of god i stand and thence
against the undivulgd pretence i fight
of treasonous mallice
and so doe i
so all
lets briefely put on manly readinesse
and meet ith hall together
well contented
what will you doe
lets not consort with them
to shew an unfelt sorrow is an office
which the false man dos easy ile to england
to ireland i
our seperated fortune shall keepe us both the safer
where we are theres daggers in mens smiles
the neere in blood the neerer bloody
this murtherous shaft thats shot
hath not yet lighted and our safest way
is to avoid the ayme therefore to horse
and let us not be dainty of leavetaking
but shift away theres warrant in that theft
which steales it selfe when theres no mercy left
threescore and ten i can remember well
within the volume of which time i have seene
houres dreadfull and things strange but this sore night
hath trifled former knowings
ha good father
thou seest the heavens as troubled with mans act
threatens his bloody stage byth clock tis day
and yet darke night strangles the travailing lampe
ist nights predominance or the dayes shame
that darkness does the face of earth intombe
when living light should kisse it
tis unnaturall
even like the deed thats done on tvesday last
a faulcon towring in her pride of place
was by a mowsing owle hawkt at and killd
and duncans horses
a thing most strange and certaine
beauteous and swift the minions of their race
turnd wilde in nature broke their stalls flong out
contending gainst obedience as they would
make warre with mankinde
tis said they eate each other
they did so
to th amazement of mine eyes that lookd upont
enter macduffe
why see you not
ist known who did this more then bloody deed
those that macbeth hath slaine
alas the day
what good could they pretend
they were subborned
malcolme and donalbaine the kings two sonnes
are stoln away and fled which puts upon them
suspition of the deed
gainst nature still
thriftless ambition that will raven up
thine own lives meanes then tis most like
the soveraignty will fall upon macbeth
he is already namd and gone to scone
to be invested

carried to colmekill
the sacred storehouse of his predecessors
and gvardian of their bones

least our old robes sit easier then our new
farewell father
gods benyson go with you and with those
that would make good of bad and friends of foes
thou hast it now king cawdor glamis all
as the weyard women promisd and i feare
thou playdst most fowly fort yet it was saide
it should not stand in thy posterity
but that my selfe should be the roote and father
of many kings if there come truth from them
as upon thee macbeth their speeches shine
why by the verities on thee made good
may they not be my oracles as well
and set me up in hope but hush no more

and allthing unbecomming

and so i doe commend you to their backs
farwell

gate

it was so please your highnesse
well then
now have you considerd of my speeches
know that it was he in the times past
which held you so under fortune
which you thought had been our innocent selfe
this i made good to you in our last conference
past in probation with you
how you were born in hand how crost
the instruments who wrought with them
and all things else that might
to halfe a soule and to a notion crazd
say thus did banquo
you made it known to us
i did so
and went further which is now
our point of second meeting
doe you finde your patience so predominant
in your nature that you can let this goe
are you so gospelld to pray for this good man
and for his issve whose heavy hand
hath bowd you to the grave and beggerd
yours for ever
we are men my liege
i in the catalogve ye goe for men
as hounds and greyhounds mungrels spaniels curres
showghes waterrugs and demywolves are clipt
all by the name of dogges the valved file
distingvishes the swift the slow the subtle
the housekeeper the hunter every one
according to the gift which bounteous nature
hath in him closd whereby he does receive
particular addition from the bill
that writes them all alike and so of men
now if you have a station in the file
not ith worst ranke of manhood sayt
and i will put that business in your bosomes
whose execution takes your enemy off
grapples you to the heart and love of us
who weare our health but sickly in his life
which in his death were perfect
i am one my liege
whom the vile blowes and buffets of the world
hath so incensd that i am reckless what i doe
to spight the world
and i another
so weary with disasters tuggd with fortune
that i would set my life on any chance
to mend it or be rid ont
both of you know banquo was your enemy trve my lord
so is he mine and in such bloody distance
that every minute of his being thrusts
against my neerst of life and though i could
with barefacd power sweepe him from my sight
and bid my will avouch it yet i must not
for certaine friends that are both his and mine
whose loves i may not drop but wayle his fall
who i my selfe struck down and thence it is
that i to your assistance doe make love
masking the business from the common eye
for sundry weighty reasons
we shall my lord
performe what you command us
though our lives
your spirits shine through you
within this houre at most
i will advise you where to plant your selves
acquaint you with the perfect spy oth time
the moment ont fort must be done to night
and something from the pallace alwayes thought
that i require a cleareness and with him
to leave no rubs nor botches in the worke
fleans  his sonn that keepes him company whose absence is no less materiall to me
then is his fathers must embrace the fate
of that darke houre resolve your selves apart
ile come to you anon
we are resolud my lord
ile call upon you straight abide within
it is concluded banquo thy soules flight
if it finde heaven must finde it out to night
is banquo gone from court
i madame but returnes againe to night
say to the king i would attend his leysure
for a few words
madame i will
enter
noughts had alls spent
where our desire is got without content
tis safer to be that which we destroy
then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy
enter macbeth
we have scorchd the snake not killd it
sheele close and be her selfe whilest our poore mallice
remaines in danger of her former tooth
but let the frame of things disioynt
both the worlds suffer
ere we will eate our meale in feare and sleepe
in the affliction of these terrible dreames
that shake us nightly better be with the dead
whom we to gayne our peace have sent to peace
then on the torture of the minde to lye
in restless extasy duncane is in his grave
after lifes fitfull fever he sleepes well
treason has done his worst nor steele nor poyson
mallice domestique forraine levy nothing
can touch him further
come on
gentle my lord sleeke ore your rugged lookes
be bright and ioviall among your gvests to night
so shall i love and so i pray be you
let your remembrance apply to banquo
present him eminence both with eye and tongve
unsafe the while that wee must lave
our honors in these flattering streames
and make our faces vizards to our hearts
disgvising what they are
you must leave this
o full of scorpions is my minde deare wife
thou knowst that banquo and his fleans lives
but in them natures coppies not eterne
theres comfort yet they are assaileable
then be thou iocund ere the bat hath flowne
his cloysterd flight ere to black heccats summons
the shardborn beetle with his drowsy hums
hath rung nights yawning peale
there shall be done a deed of dreadfull note
whats to be done
be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
till thou applaud the deed come seeling night
skarfe up the tender eye of pittifull day
and with thy bloody and invisible hand
cancell and teare to pieces that great bond
which keepes me pale light thickens
and the crow makes wing toth rooky wood
good things of day begin to droope and drowse
whiles nights black agents to their preys doe rowse
thou marvellst at my words but hold thee still
things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
so prythee goe with me
but who did bid thee ioyne with us
macbeth
he needes not our mistrust since he delivers
our offices and what we have to doe
to the direction just
then stand with us

now spurres the lated traveller apace
to gayne the timely inn and neere approches
the subiect of our watch
hearke i heare horses

which might appall the divell
o proper stuffe
this is the very painting of your feare
this is the ayredrawnedagger which you said

impostors to trve feare would well become
a womans story at a winters fire
authorizd by her grandam shame it selfe
why do you make such faces when alls done

ere humane statute purgd the gentle weale
i and since too murthers have bene performd
too terrible for the eare the times has bene
that when the braines were out the man would dye
and there an end but now they rise againe
with twenty mortall murthers on their crownes
and push us from our stooles this is more strange
then such a murther is

to those that know me come love and health to all
then ile sit down give me some wine fill full

onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time
what man dare i dare
approach thou like the rugged russian beare
the armd rhinoceros or th hircan tiger
take any shape but that and my firme nerves
shall never tremble or be alive againe
and dare me to the desart with thy sword
if trembling i inhabit then protest mee
the baby of a girle hence horrible shadow
unreall mockry hence why so being gone
i am a man againe pray you sit still
you have displacd the mirth
broke the good meeting with most admird disorder
can such things be
and overcome us like a summers clowd
without our speciall wonder you make me strange
even to the disposition that i owe
when now i thinke you can behold such sights
and keepe the naturall ruby of your cheekes
when mine is blanchd with feare
what sights my lord

question enrages him at once goodnight
stand not upon the order of your going
but go at once
good night and better health
attend his maiesty

it will have blood they say
blood will have blood
stones have beene known to move  trees to speake
augures and understood relations have
by maggot pyes  choughes  rookes brought forth
the secretst man of blood what is the night
almost at oddes with morning which is which
how sayst thou that macduff denies his person
at our great bidding

theres not a one of them but in his house
i keepe a servant feed i will to morrow
and betimes i will to the weyard sisters
more shall they speake for now i am bent to know
by the worst meanes the worst for mine own good
all causes shall give way i am in blood
stept in so farre that should i wade no more
returning were as tedious as go ore
strange things i have in head that will to hand
which must be acted ere they may be scand
you lacke the season of all natures sleepe
come weel to sleepe my strange  selfabuse
is the initiate feare that wants hard use
we are yet but yong indeed
why how now hecat you looke angerly
have i not reason beldams as you are
sawcy and overbold how did you dare
to trade and trafficke with macbeth
in riddles and affaires of death
and i the mistris of your charmes
the close contriver of all harmes
was never calld to beare my part
or shew the glory of our art
and which is worse all you have done
hath bene but for a wayward sonne
spightfull and wrathfull who as others do
loves for his own ends not for you
but make amends now get you gon
and at the pit of acheron
meete me ith morning thither he
will come to know his destiny your vessels and your spels provide
your charmes and every thing beside
i am for th ayre this night ile spend

great business must be wrought ere noone
upon the corner of the moone
there hangs a vaprous drop profound
ile catch it ere it come to ground
and that distilld by magicke slights
shall raise such artificiall sprights
as by the strength of their illusion
shall draw him on to his confusion
he shall spurn fate scorn death and beare
his hopes bove wisedome grace and feare
and you all know security
is mortals cheefest enemy come lets make hast sheel soone be
backe againe
my former speeches
have but hit your thoughts
which can interpret farther onely i say
things have bin strangely born the gracious duncan
was pittied of macbeth marry he was dead
and the right valiant banquo walkd too late
whom you may say ift please you fleans killd
for fleans fled men must not walke too late
who cannot want the thought how monstrous
it was for malcolme and for donalbane
to kill their gracious father damned fact
how it did greeve macbeth did he not straight
in pious rage the two delinquents teare
that were the slaves of drinke and thralles of sleepe
was not that nobly done i and wisely too
for twould have angerd any heart alive
to heare the men denyt so that i say
he has born all things well and i do thinke
that had he duncans sonnes under his key
as andt please heaven he shall not they should finde
what twere to kill a father so should fleans
but peace for from broad words and cause he fayld
his presence at the tyrants feast i heare
macduffe lives in disgrace sir can you tell
where he bestowes himselfe
the sonnes of duncane
from whom this tyrant holds the dve of birth
lives in the english court and is receyud
of the most pious edward with such grace
that the malevolence of fortune nothing
takes from his high respect thither macduffe
is gone to pray the holy king upon his ayd
to wake northumberland and warlike seyward
that by the helpe of these with him above
to ratify the worke we may againe
give to our tables meate sleepe to our nights
free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
do faithfull homage and receive free honors
all which we pine for now and this report
hath so exasperate their king that hee
prepares for some attempt of warre
sent he to macduffe
he did and with an absolute sir not i
the clowdy messenger turnes me his backe
and hums as who should say youl rve the time
that clogges me with this answer
and that well might
advise him to a caution t hold what distance
his wisedome can provide some holy angell
flye to the court of england and unfold
his message ere he come that a swift blessing
may soone return to this our suffering country
under a hand accursd
ile send my prayers with him
thrice the brinded cat hath mewd

while you performe your antique round

and damnd all those that trust them i did heare
the gallopping of horse who wast came by
tis two or three my lord that bring you word
macduff is fled to england
fled to england
i my good lord
time thou anticipatst my dread exploits
the flighty purpose never is oretooke
unless the deed go with it from this moment
the very firstlings of my heart shall be
the firstlings of my hand and even now
to crown my thoughts with acts be it thoght  done
the castle of macduff i will surprize
seize upon fife give to th edge oth sword
his wife his babes and all unfortunate soules
that trace him in his line no boasting like a foole
this deed ile do before this purpose coole
but no more sights where are these gentlemen
come bring me where they are
what had he done to make him fly the land
you must have patience madam
he had none
his flight was madness when our actions do not
our feares do make us traitors
you know not
whether it was his wisedome or his feare
wisedom to leave his wife to leave his babes
his mansion and his titles in a place
from whence himselfe dos flye he loves us not
he wants the naturall touch for the poore wren
the most diminitive of birds will fight
her yong ones in her nest against the owle
all is the feare and nothing is the love
as little is the wisedome where the flight
so runnes against all reason
my deerest cooz
i pray you schoole your selfe but for your husband
he is noble wise judicious and best knowes
the fits oth season i dare not speake much further
but crvell are the times when we are traitors
and do not know our selves when we hold rumor
from what we feare yet know not what we feare
but floate upon a wilde and violent sea
each way and move i take my leave of you
shall not be long but ile be heere againe
things at the worst will cease or else climbe upward
to what they were before my pretty cosine
blessing upon you
fatherd he is
and yet hees fatherlesse
i am so much a foole should i stay longer
it would be my disgrace and your discomfort
i take my leave at once
sirra your fathers dead
and what will you do now how will you live
as birds do mother
what with wormes and flyes
with what i get i meane and so do they
poore bird
thoudst never feare the net nor lime
the pitfall nor the gin
why should i mother
poore birds they are not set for
my father is not dead for all your saying
yes he is dead
how wilt thou do for a father
nay how will you do for a husband
why i can bvy me twenty at any market
then youl by em to sell againe
thou speakst withall thy wit
and yet ifaith with wit enough for thee
was my father a traitor mother
i that he was
what is a traitor
why one that sweares and lyes
and be all traitors that do so
every one that dos so is a traitor
and must be hangd
and must they all be hangd that swear and lye
every one
who must hang them
why the honest men
then the liars and swearers are fools for there
are lyars and swearers enow to beate the honest men
and hang up them
now god helpe thee poore monky but how wilt thou do for a father
if he were dead yould weepe for him if you
would not it were a good signe that i should quickely
have a new father
poore pratler how thou talkst
enter a messenger
bless you faire dame i am not to you known
though in your state of honor i am perfect
i doubt some danger dos approach you neerely
if you will take a homely mans advice
be not found heere hence with your little ones
to fright you thus me thinkes i am too savage
to do worse to you were fell crvelty
which is too ny your person heaven preserve you
i dare abide no longer
whether should i flye
i have done no harme but i remember now
i am in this earthly world where to do harme
is often laudable to do good sometime
accounted dangerous folly why then alas
do i put up that womanly defence
to say i have done no harme
what are these faces
enter murtherers
where is your husband
i hope in no place so unsanctified
where such as thou mayst finde him
hes a traitor
thou lyst thou shaggeeard villaine
what you egge
yong fry of treachery
he has killd me mother
run away i pray you
let us seeke out some desolate shade  there
weepe our sad bosomes empty
let us rather
hold fast the mortall sword and like good men
bestride our downfall birthdome each new morne
new widdowes howle new orphans cry new sorowes
strike heaven on the face that it resounds
as if it felt with scotland and yelld out
like syllable of dolour
what i beleeve ile waile
what know beleeve and what i can redresse
as i shall finde the time to friend i wil
what you have spoke it may be so perchance
this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongves
was once thought honest you have loud him well
he hath not touchd you yet i am yong but something
you may discern of him through me and wisedome
to offer up a weake poore innocent lambe
t appease an angry god
i am not treacherous
but macbeth is
a good and vertvous nature may recoyle
in an imperiall charge but i shall crave your pardon
that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
angels are bright still though the brightest fell
though all things foule would wear the brows of grace
yet grace must still looke so
i have lost my hopes
perchance even there
where i did finde my doubts
why in that rawness left you wife and childe
those precious motives those strong knots of love
without leavetaking i pray you
let not my iealousies be your dishonors
but mine own safeties you may be rightly just
what ever i shall thinke
bleed bleed poore country
great tyrrany lay thou thy basis sure
for goodness dare not check thee wear y thy wrongs
the title is affeard far thee well lord
i would not be the villaine that thou thinkst
for the whole space thats in the tyrants graspe
and the rich east to boot
be not offended
i speake not as in absolute feare of you
i thinke our country sinkes beneath the yoake
it weepes it bleeds and each new day a gash
is added to her wounds i thinke withall
there would be hands uplifted in my right
and heere from gracious england have i offer
of goodly thousands but for all this
when i shall treade upon the tyrants head
or weare it on my sword yet my poore country
shall have more vices then it had before
more suffer and more sundry wayes then ever
by him that shall succeede
what should he be
it is my selfe i meane in whom i know
all the particulars of vice so grafted
that when they shall be opend blacke macbeth
will seeme as pure as snow and the poore state
esteeme him as a lambe being compard
with my confineless harmes
not in the legions
of horrid hell can come a divell more damnd
in evils to top macbeth
i grant him bloody
luxurious avaricious false deceitfull
sodaine malicious smacking of every sinne
that has a name but theres no bottome none
in my voluptvousness your wives your daughters
your matrons and your maides could not fill up
the cestern of my lust and my desire
all continent impediments would orebeare
that did oppose my will better macbeth
then such an one to reigne
boundless intemperance
in nature is a tyranny it hath beene
th untimely emptying of the happy throne
and fall of many kings but feare not yet
to take upon you what is yours you may
convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
and yet seeme cold the time you may so hoodwinke
we have willing dames enough there cannot be
that vulture in you to devoure so many
as will to greatness dedicate themselves
finding it so inclinde
with this there growes
in my most illcomposd affection such
a stanchless avarice that were i king
i should cut off the nobles for their lands
desire his iewels and this others house
and my morehaving would be as a sawce
to make me hunger more that i should forge
quarrels uniust against the good and loyall
destroying them for wealth
this avarice
stickes deeper growes with more pernicious roote
then summerseeming lust and it hath bin
the sword of our slaine kings yet do not feare
scotland hath foysons to fill up your will
of your meere own all these are portable
with other graces weighd
but i have noneas justice verity temprance stablenesse
bounty perseverance mercy lowlinesse
devotion patience courage fortitude
i have no rellish of them but abound
in the division of each severall crime
acting it many wayes nay had i powre i should
poure the sweet milke of concord into hell
uprore the universall peace confound
all unity on earth
o scotland scotland
if such a one be fit to govern speake
i am as i have spoken
fit to govern no not to livewith an untitled tyrant bloody sceptred
when shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe
since that the trvest issve of thy throne
by his own interdiction stands accust
and dos blaspheme his breed thy royall father
was a most saintedking the queene that bore thee
oftner upon her knees then on her feet
dyde every day she liud fare thee well
these evils thou repeatst upon thy selfe
hath banishd me from scotland o my brest
thy hope ends heere
macduff this noble passion
childe of integrity hath from my soule
wipd the blacke scruples reconcild my thoughts
to thy good truth and honor divellish macbeth
by many of these traines hath sought to win me
into his power and modest wisedome pluckes me
from overcredulous hast but god above
deale betweene thee and me for even now
i put my selfe to thy direction and
unspeake mine own detraction heere abiure
the taints and blames i laide upon my selfe
for strangers to my nature i am yet
unknown to woman never was forsworne
scarsely have coveted what was mine owne
at no time broke my faith would not betray
the devill to his fellow and delight
no less in truth then life my first false speaking
was this upon my selfe what i am truly
is thine and my poore countries to command
whither indeed before they heere approach
old seyward with ten thousand warlike men
already at a point was setting foorth
now weel together and the chance of goodnesse
be like our warranted quarrell why are you silent
such welcome and unwelcom things at once
tis hard to reconcile
enter a doctor

that stay his cure their malady convinces
the great assay of art but at his touch
such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
they presently amend

tis calld the evill
a most myraculous worke in this good king
which often since my heere remaine in england
i have seene him do how he solicites heaven
himselfe best knowes but strangely visited people
all swoln and ulcerous pittifull to the eye
the meere dispaire of surgery he cures
hanging a golden stampe about their neckes
put on with holy prayers and tis spoken
to the succeeding royalty he leaves
the healing benediction with this strange vertve
he hath a heavenly gvift of prophesy and sundry blessings hang about his throne
that speake him full of grace
enter rosse
see who comes heere
my countryman but yet i know him not
my ever gentle cozen welcome hither
i know him nowthe meanes that makes us strangers
sir amen
stands scotland where it did
alas poore countrey
almost affraid to know it selfe it cannot
be calld our mother but our grave where nothing
but who knowes nothing is once seene to smile
where sighes and groanes and shrieks that rent the ayre
are made not markd where violent sorrow seemes
a modern extasy the deadmans knell
is there scarse askd for who and good mens lives
expire before the flowers in their caps
dying or ere they sicken
oh relation too nice and yet too trve
whats the newest griefe
that of an houres age doth hisse the speaker
each minute teemes a new one
how dos my wife
why well
and all my children
well too
the tyrant has not batterd at their peace
no they were wel at peace when i did leave em
be not a niggard of your speech how gost
when i came hither to transport the tydings
which i have heavily born there ran a rumour
of many worthy fellowes that were out
which was to my beleefe witnest the rather
for that i saw the tyrants power afoot
now is the time of helpe your eye in scotland
would create soldiours make our women fight
to doffe their dire distresses
beet their comfort
we are comming thither gracious england hath
lent us good seyward and ten thousand men
an older and a better souldier none
that christendome gives out
would i could answer
this comfort with the like but i have words
that would be howld out in the desert ayre
where hearing should not latch them
what concern they
the generall cause or is it a feegriefe
dve to some single brest
no minde thats honest
but in it shares some woe though the maine part
pertaines to you alone
if it be mine
keepe it not from me quickly let me have it
let not your eares dispise my tongve for ever
which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard
humh i gvess at it

savagely slaughterd to relate the manner
were on the quarry of these murtherd deere
to adde the death of you
mercifull heaven

give sorrow words the griefe that dos not speake
whispers the orefraught heart and bids it breake
my children too
wife children servants all that could be found
and i must be from thence my wife kild too
i have said
be comforted
lets make us medcines of our great revenge
to cure this deadly greefe
he has no childrendid you say all oh hellkite all
what all my pretty chickens and their damme

dispute it like a man
i shall do so
but i must also feele it as a man
i cannot but remember such things were
that were most precious to me did heaven looke on
and would not take their part sinfull macduff
they were all strooke for thee naught that i am
not for their own demerits but for mine
fell slaughter on their soules heaven rest them now
be this the whetstone of your sword let griefe
convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
o i could play the woman with mine eyes
and braggart with my tongve but gentle heavens
cut short all intermission front to front
bring thou this fiend of scotland and my selfe
within my swords length set him if he scape
heaven forgive him too
this time goes manly

once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching
in this slumbry agitation besides her walking and other
actvall performances what at any time have you heard
her say

of all the gentry there is seywards sonne
and many unruffe youths that even now
protest their first of manhood
what dos the tyrant
great dunsinane he strongly fortifies
some say hees mad others that lesser hate him
do call it valiant fury but for certaine
he cannot buckle his distemperd cause
within the belt of rule
now dos he feele
his secret murthers sticking on his hands
now minutely revolts upbraid his faithbreach
those he commands move onely in command
nothing in love now dos he feele his title
hang loose about him like a giants robe
upon a dwarfish theefe
who then shall blame
his pesterd senses to recoyle and start
when all that is within him dos condemne
it selfe for being there
well march we on
to give obedience where tis truly owd
meet we the medcine of the sickly weale
and with him poure we in our countries purge
each drop of us
or so much as it needes
to dew the soveraigne flower and drown the weeds
make we our march towards birnan
bring me no more reports let them flye all
till byrnane wood remove to dunsinane
i cannot taint with feare whats the boy malcolme
was he not born of woman the spirits that know
all mortall consequences have pronouncd me thus
feare not macbeth no man thats born of woman

canst thou not minister to a minde diseasd
plucke from the memory a rooted sorrow
raze out the written troubles of the braine
and with some sweet oblivious antidote

which weighes upon the heart

must minister to himselfe
throw physicke to the dogs ile none of it

that should applaud againe pullt off i say
what rubarb cyme or what purgative drugge
would scowre these english hence hearst y of them
i my good lord your royall preparation
makes us heare something
bring it after me
i will not be affraid of death and bane
till birnane forrest come to dunsinane
were i from dunsinane away and cleere
profit againe should hardly draw me heere
cosins i hope the dayes are neere at hand
that chambers will be safe
we doubt it nothing
what wood is this before us
the wood of birnane
let every souldier hew him down a bough
and beart before him thereby shall we shadow
the numbers of our hoast and make discovery
erre in report of us
it shall be done
we learn no other but the confident tyrant
keepes still in dunsinane and will indure
our setting down befort
tis his maine hope
for where there is advantage to be given
both more and less have given him the revolt
and none serve with him but constrained things
whose hearts are absent too
let our just censures
attend the trve event and put we on
industrious souldiership
the time approaches
that will with dve decision make us know
what we shall say we have and what we owe
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
but certaine issve stroakes must arbitrate
towards which advance the warre
hang out our banners on the outward walls
the cry is still they come our castles strength
will laugh a siedge to scorn heere let them lye
till famine and the agve eate them up
were they not forcd with those that should be ours
we might have met them darefull beard to beard
and beate them backward home what is that noyse
it is the cry of women my good lord
i have almost forgot the taste of feares
the time has beene my sences would have coold
to heare a nightshrieke and my fell of haire
would at a dismall treatise rowze and stirre
as life were int i have supt full with horrors
direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
cannot once start me wherefore was that cry
the queene my lord is dead
she should have dyde heereafter
there would have beene a time for such a word
to morrow and to morrow and to morrow
creepes in this petty pace from day to day
to the last syllable of recorded time
and all our yesterdayes have lighted fooles
the way to dusty death out out breefe candle
lifes but a walking shadow a poore player
that struts and frets his houre upon the stage
and then is heard no more it is a tale
told by an ideot full of sound and fury
signifying nothing
enter a messenger
gracious my lord
i should report that which i say i saw
but know not how to doot
well say sir
as i did stand my watch upon the hill
i lookd toward byrnane and anon me thought
the wood began to move
lyar and slave
let me endure your wrath ift be not so
within this three mile may you see it comming
i say a moving grove
if thou speakst false
upon the next tree shall thou hang alive
till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
i care not if thou dost for me as much
i pull in resolution and begin
to doubt th equivocation of the fiend
that lies like truth feare not till byrnane wood
do come to dunsinane and now a wood
comes toward dunsinane arme arme and out
if this which he avouches dos appeare
there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
i ginn to be aweary of the sun
and wish th estate oth world were now undon
ring the alarum bell blow winde come wracke
at least weel dye with harness on our backe
now neere enough
your leavy skreenes throw downe
and shew like those you are you worthy unkle
shall with my cosin your right noble sonne
leade our first battell worthy macduffe and wee
shall take upons what else remaines to do
according to our order
fare you well
do we but finde the tyrants power to night
let us be beaten if we cannot fight
make all our trumpets speak give them all breath
those clamorous harbingers of blood  death
they have tied me to a stake i cannot flye
but bearelike i must fight the course whats he
that was not born of woman such a one
am i to feare or none
enter young seyward
what is thy name
thoult be affraid to heare it
no though thou callst thy selfe a hoter name
then any is in hell
my names macbeth
the divell himselfe could not pronounce a title
more hatefull to mine eare
no nor more fearefull
thou lyest abhorred tyrant with my sword
ile prove the lye thou speakst
thou wast born of woman
but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorne
brandishd by man thats of a woman borne
enter
that way the noise is tyrant shew thy face
if thou beest slaine and with no stroake of mine
my wife and childrens ghosts will haunt me still
i cannot strike at wretched kernes whose armes
are hyrd to beare their staves either thou macbeth
or else my sword with an unbattered edge
i sheath againe undeeded there thou shouldst be
by this great clatter one of greatest note
seemes brvited let me finde him fortune
and more i begge not
this way my lord the castles gently rendred
the tyrants people on both sides do fight
the noble thanes do bravely in the warre
the day almost it selfe professes yours
and little is to do
we have met with foes
that strike beside us
enter sir the castle
why should i play the roman foole and dye
on mine own sword whiles i see lives the gashes
do better upon them
enter macduffe
turn hellhound turne
of all men else i have avoyded thee
but get thee backe my soule is too much chargd
with blood of thine already
i have no words
my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villaine
then tearmes can give thee out
thou loosest labour
as easy mayst thou the intrenchant ayre
with thy keene sword impress as make me bleed
let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
i beare a charmed life which must not yeeld
to one of woman borne
dispaire thy charme
and let the angell whom thou still hast serud
tell thee macduffe was from his mothers womb
untimely ript
accursed be that tongve that tels mee so
for it hath cowd my better part of man
and be these jugling fiends no more beleeud
that palter with us in a double sence
that keepe the word of promise to our eare
and breake it to our hope ile not fight with thee
then yeeld thee coward
and live to be the shew and gaze oth time
weel have thee as our rarer monsters are
painted upon a pole and underwrit
heere may you see the tyrant
i will not yeeld
to kisse the ground before young malcolmes feet
and to be baited with the rabbles curse
though byrnane wood be come to dunsinane
and thou opposd being of no woman borne
yet i will try the last before my body
i throw my warlike shield lay on macduffe
and damnd be him that first cries hold enough
i would the friends we misse were safe arriud
some must go off and yet by these i see
so great a day as this is cheapely bought
macduffe is missing and your noble sonne
your son my lord has paid a souldiers debt
he onely liud but till he was a man
the which no sooner had his prowess confirmd
in the unshrinking station where he fought
but like a man he dyde
then he is dead
i and brought off the field your cause of sorrow
must not be measurd by his worth for then
it hath no end
had he his hurts before
i on the front
why then gods soldier be he
had i as many sonnes as i have haires
i would not wish them to a fairer death
and so his knell is knolld
hees worth more sorrow
and that ile spend for him
hes worth no more
they say he parted well and paid his score
and so god be with him here comes newer comfort
enter macduffe with macbeths head
haile king for so thou art
behold where stands
th usurpers cursed head the time is free
i see thee compast with thy kingdomes pearle
that speake my salutation in their minds
whose voyces i desire alowd with mine
haile king of scotland
haile king of scotland
we shall not spend a large expence of time
before we reckon with your severall loves
and make us even with you my thanes and kinsmen
henceforth be earles the first that ever scotland
in such an honor namd whats more to do
which would be planted newly with the time
as calling home our exild friends abroad
that fled the snares of watchfull tyranny
producing forth the crvell ministers
of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queene
who as tis thought by selfe and violent hands
tooke off her life this and what need full else
that calls upon us by the grace of grace
we will performe in measure time and place
so thankes to all at once and to each one
whom we invite to see us crownd at scone
