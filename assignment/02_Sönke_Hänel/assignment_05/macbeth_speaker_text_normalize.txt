when shall we three meet againe
in thunder lightning or in raine
when the hurleyburleys done
when the battailes lost and wonne
that will be ere the set of sunne
where the place
vpon the heath
there to meet with macbeth
i come graymalkin
padock calls anon faire is foule and foule is faire
houer through the fogge and filthie ayre
what bloody man is that he can report
as seemeth by his plight of the reuolt
the newest state
this is the serieant
who like a good and hardie souldier fought
gainst my captiuitie haile braue friend
say to the king the knowledge of the broyle
as thou didst leaue it
doubtfull it stood
as two spent swimmers that doe cling together
and choake their art the mercilesse macdonwald
worthie to be a rebell for to that
the multiplying villanies of nature
doe swarme vpon him from the westerne isles
of kernes and gallowgrosses is supplyd
and fortune on his damned quarry smiling
shewd like a rebells whore but alls too weake
for braue macbeth well hee deserues that name
disdayning fortune with his brandisht steele
which smoakd with bloody execution
like valours minion carud out his passage
till hee facd the slaue
which neur shooke hands nor bad farwell to him
till he vnseamd him from the naue toth chops
and fixd his head vpon our battlements
o valiant cousin worthy gentleman
as whence the sunne gins his reflection
shipwracking stormes and direfull thunders
so from that spring whence comfort seemd to come
discomfort swells marke king of scotland marke
no sooner iustice had with valour armd
compelld these skipping kernes to trust their heeles
but the norweyan lord surueying vantage
with furbusht armes and new supplyes of men
began a fresh assault
dismayd not this our captaines macbeth and
banquoh
yes as sparrowes eagles
or the hare the lyon
if i say sooth i must report they were
as cannons ouerchargd with double cracks
so they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the foe
except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
or memorize another golgotha
i cannot tell but i am faint
my gashes cry for helpe
so well thy words become thee as thy wounds
they smack of honor both goe get him surgeons
enter rosse and angus

so should he looke that seemes to speake things strange
god saue the king
whence camst thou worthy thane
from fiffe great king
where the norweyan banners flowt the skie
and fanne our people cold
norway himselfe with terrible numbers
assisted by that most disloyall traytor
the thane of cawdor began a dismall conflict
till that bellonas bridegroome lapt in proofe
confronted him with selfecomparisons
point against point rebellious arme gainst arme
curbing his lauish spirit and to conclude
the victorie fell on vs
great happinesse
that now sweno the norwayes king
craues composition
nor would we deigne him buriall of his men
till he disbursed at saint colmes ynch
ten thousand dollars to our generall vse
no more that thane of cawdor shall deceiue
our bosome interest goe pronounce his present death
and with his former title greet macbeth

enter macbeth and banquo
so foule and faire a day i haue not seene
how farre ist calld to soris what are these
so witherd and so wilde in their attyre
that looke not like th inhabitants oth earth
and yet are ont liue you or are you aught
that man may question you seeme to vnderstand me
by each at once her choppie finger laying
vpon her skinnie lips you should be women
and yet your beards forbid me to interprete
that you are so
speake if you can what are you
all haile macbeth haile to thee thane of glamis
all haile macbeth haile to thee thane of cawdor
all haile macbeth that shalt be king hereafter
good sir why doe you start and seeme to feare
things that doe sound so faire ith name of truth
are ye fantasticall or that indeed
which outwardly ye shew my noble partner
you greet with present grace and great prediction
of noble hauing and of royall hope
that he seemes wrapt withall to me you speake not
if you can looke into the seedes of time
and say which graine will grow and which will not
speake then to me who neyther begge nor feare

lesser than macbeth and greater
not so happy yet much happyer
thou shalt get kings though thou be none
so all haile macbeth and banquo
banquo and macbeth all haile
stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
by sinells death i know i am thane of glamis
but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor liues
a prosperous gentleman and to be king
stands not within the prospect of beleefe
no more then to be cawdor say from whence
you owe this strange intelligence or why
vpon this blasted heath you stop our way
with such prophetique greeting
speake i charge you
the earth hath bubbles as the water has
and these are of them whither are they vanishd
into the ayre and what seemd corporall
melted as breath into the winde
would they had stayd
were such things here as we doe speake about
or haue we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner
your children shall be kings
you shall be king
and thane of cawdor too went it not so
toth selfesame tune and words whos here
enter rosse and angus
the king hath happily receiud macbeth
the newes of thy successe and when he reades
thy personall venture in the rebels sight
his wonders and his prayses doe contend
which should be thine or his silencd with that
in viewing ore the rest oth selfesame day
he findes thee in the stout norweyan rankes
nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make
strange images of death as thick as tale
can post with post and euery one did beare
thy prayses in his kingdomes great defence
and powrd them downe before him
wee are sent
to giue thee from our royall master thanks
onely to harrold thee into his sight
not pay thee
and for an earnest of a greater honor
he bad me from him call thee thane of cawdor
in which addition haile most worthy thane
for it is thine
what can the deuill speake true
the thane of cawdor liues
why doe you dresse me in borrowed robes
who was the thane liues yet
but vnder heauie iudgement beares that life
which he deserues to loose
whether he was combind with those of norway
or did lyne the rebell with hidden helpe
and vantage or that with both he labourd
in his countreyes wracke i know not
but treasons capitall confessd and proud
haue ouerthrowne him
glamys and thane of cawdor
the greatest is behinde thankes for your paines
doe you not hope your children shall be kings
when those that gaue the thane of cawdor to me
promisd no lesse to them
that trusted home
might yet enkindle you vnto the crowne
besides the thane of cawdor but tis strange
and oftentimes to winne vs to our harme
the instruments of darknesse tell vs truths
winne vs with honest trifles to betrays
in deepest consequence
cousins a word i pray you
two truths are told
as happy prologues to the swelling act
of the imperiall theame i thanke you gentlemen
this supernaturall solliciting
cannot be ill cannot be good
if ill why hath it giuen me earnest of successe
commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor
if good why doe i yeeld to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth vnfixe my heire
and make my seated heart knock at my ribbes
against the vse of nature present feares
are lesse then horrible imaginings
my thought whose murther yet is but fantasticall
shakes so my single state of man
that function is smotherd in surmise
and nothing is but what is not
looke how our partners rapt
if chance will haue me king
why chance may crowne me
without my stirre
new honors come vpon him
like our strange garments cleaue not to their mould
but with the aid of vse
come what come may
time and the houre runs through the roughest day
worthy macbeth wee stay vpon your leysure
giue me your fauour
my dull braine was wrought with things forgotten
kinde gentlemen your paines are registred
where euery day i turne the leafe
to reade them
let vs toward the king thinke vpon
what hath chancd and at more time
the interim hauing weighd it let vs speake
our free hearts each to other
very gladly
till then enough
come friends
is execution done on cawdor
or not those in commission yet returnd
my liege they are not yet come back
but i haue spoke with one that saw him die
who did report that very frankly hee
confessd his treasons implord your highnesse pardon
and set forth a deepe repentance
nothing in his life became him
like the leauing it hee dyde
as one that had beene studied in his death
to throw away the dearest thing he owd
as twere a carelesse trifle
theres no art
to finde the mindes construction in the face
he was a gentleman on whom i built
an absolute trust
enter macbeth banquo rosse and angus
the seruice and the loyaltie i owe
in doing it payes it selfe
your highnesse part is to receiue our duties
and our duties are to your throne and state
children and seruants which doe but what they should
by doing euery thing safe toward your loue
and honor
welcome hither
i haue begun to plant thee and will labour
to make thee full of growing noble banquo
that hast no lesse deserud nor must be knowne
no lesse to haue done so let me enfold thee
and hold thee to my heart
there if i grow
the haruest is your owne
my plenteous ioyes
wanton in fulnesse seeke to hide themselues
in drops of sorrow sonnes kinsmen thanes
and you whose places are the nearest know
we will establish our estate vpon
our eldest malcolme whom we name hereafter
the prince of cumberland which honor must
not vnaccompanied inuest him onely
but signes of noblenesse like starres shall shine
on all deseruers from hence to envernes
and binde vs further to you
the rest is labor which is not vsd for you
ile be my selfe the herbenger and make ioyfull
the hearing of my wife with your approach
so humbly take my leaue
my worthy cawdor
the prince of cumberland that is a step
on which i must fall downe or else oreleape
for in my way it lyes starres hide your fires
let not light see my black and deepe desires

which the eye feares when it is done to see
enter
true worthy banquo he is full so valiant
and in his commendations i am fed
it is a banquet to me lets after him
whose care is gone before to bid vs welcome

they met me in the day of successe and i haue
learnd by the perfectst report they haue more in them then
mortall knowledge when i burnt in desire to question them
further they made themselues ayre into which they vanishd
whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it came missiues from
the king who allhaild me thane of cawdor by which title
before these weyward sisters saluted me and referrd me to
the comming on of time with haile king that shalt be this
haue i thought good to deliuer thee my dearest partner of
greatnesse that thou mightst not loose the dues of reioycing
by being ignorant of what greatnesse is promisd thee lay
it to thy heart and farewell
glamys thou art and cawdor and shalt be
what thou art promisd yet doe i feare thy nature
it is too full oth milke of humane kindnesse
to catch the neerest way thou wouldst be great

the illnesse should attend it what thou wouldst highly
that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
and yet wouldst wrongly winne
thouldst haue great glamys that which cryes
thus thou must doe if thou haue it
and that which rather thou dost feare to doe
then wishest should be vndone high thee hither
that i may powre my spirits in thine eare
and chastise with the valour of my tongue
all that impeides thee from the golden round
which fate and metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
to haue thee crownd withall

he has almost supt why haue you left the chamber
hath he askd for me

we will proceed no further in this businesse
he hath honourd me of late and i haue bought
golden opinions from all sorts of people
which would be worne now in their newest glosse
not cast aside so soone
was the hope drunke
wherein you drest your selfe hath it slept since
and wakes it now to looke so greene and pale
at what it did so freely from this time
such i account thy loue art thou affeard
to be the same in thine owne act and valour
as thou art in desire wouldst thou haue that
which thou esteemst the ornament of life
and liue a coward in thine owne esteeme
letting i dare not wait vpon i would
like the poore cat ith addage
prythee peace
i dare do all that may become a man
who dares do more is none
what beast wast then
that made you breake this enterprize to me
when you durst do it then you were a man
and to be more then what you were you would
be so much more the man nor time nor place
did then adhere and yet you would make both
they haue made themselues and that their fitnesse now
dos vnmake you i haue giuen sucke and know
how tender tis to loue the babe that milkes me
i would while it was smyling in my face
haue pluckt my nipple from his bonelesse gummes
and dasht the braines out had i so sworne
as you haue done to this
if we should faile
we faile
but screw your courage to the sticking place
and weele not fayle when duncan is asleepe
whereto the rather shall his dayes hard iourney
soundly inuite him his two chamberlaines
will i with wine and wassell so conuince
that memorie the warder of the braine
shall be a fume and the receit of reason
a lymbeck onely when in swinish sleepe
their drenched natures lyes as in a death
what cannot you and i performe vpon
th vnguarded duncan what not put vpon
his spungie officers who shall beare the guilt
of our great quell
bring forth menchildren onely
for thy vndaunted mettle should compose
nothing but males will it not be receiud
when we haue markd with blood those sleepie two
of his owne chamber and vsd their very daggers
that they haue dont
who dares receiue it other
as we shall make our griefes and clamor rore
vpon his death
i am settled and bend vp
each corporall agent to this terrible feat
away and mock the time with fairest show
false face must hide what the false heart doth know
how goes the night boy
the moone is downe i haue not heard the
clock
and she goes downe at twelue
i taket tis later sir
hold take my sword
theres husbandry in heauen
their candles are all out take thee that too
a heauie summons lyes like lead vpon me
and yet i would not sleepe
mercifull powers restraine in me the cursed thoughts
that nature giues way to in repose
enter macbeth and a seruant with a torch
a friend
what sir not yet at rest the kings a bed
he hath beene in vnusuall pleasure
and sent forth great largesse to your offices
this diamond he greetes your wife withall
by the name of most kind hostesse
and shut vp in measurelesse content
being vnprepard
our will became the seruant to defect
which else should free haue wrought
alls well
i dreamt last night of the three weyward sisters
to you they haue shewd some truth
i thinke not of them
yet when we can entreat an houre to serue
we would spend it in some words vpon that businesse
if you would graunt the time
at your kindst leysure
if you shall cleaue to my consent
when tis it shall make honor for you
so i lose none
in seeking to augment it but still keepe
my bosome franchisd and allegeance cleare
i shall be counsaild
good repose the while
thankes sir the like to you
goe bid thy mistresse when my drinke is ready
she strike vpon the bell get thee to bed
enter
that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
what hath quenchd them hath giuen me fire
hearke peace it was the owle that shriekd
the fatall bellman which giues the sternst goodnight
he is about it the doores are open
and the surfeted groomes doe mock their charge
with snores i haue druggd their possets
that death and nature doe contend about them
whether they liue or dye
enter macbeth
whos there what hoa
alack i am afraid they haue awakd
and tis not done th attempt and not the deed
confounds vs hearke i layd their daggers ready
he could not misse em had he not resembled
my father as he slept i had dont
my husband
i haue done the deed
didst thou not heare a noyse
i heard the owle schreame and the crickets cry
did not you speake
when
now
as i descended
i
hearke who lyes ith second chamber
donalbaine
this is a sorry sight
a foolish thought to say a sorry sight
theres one did laugh ins sleepe
and one cryd murther that they did wake each other
i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers
and addrest them againe to sleepe
there are two lodgd together
one cryd god blesse vs and amen the other
as they had seene me with these hangmans hands
listning their feare i could not say amen
when they did say god blesse vs
consider it not so deepely
but wherefore could not i pronounce amen
i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat
these deeds must not be thought
after these wayes so it will make vs mad
me thought i heard a voyce cry sleep no more
macbeth does murther sleepe the innocent sleepe
sleepe that knits vp the raueld sleeue of care
the death of each dayes life sore labors bath
balme of hurt mindes great natures second course
chiefe nourisher in lifes feast
what doe you meane
still it cryd sleepe no more to all the house
glamis hath murtherd sleepe and therefore cawdor
shall sleepe no more macbeth shall sleepe no more
who was it that thus cryd why worthy thane
you doe vnbend your noble strength to thinke
so brainesickly of things goe get some water
and wash this filthie witnesse from your hand
why did you bring these daggers from the place
they must lye there goe carry them and smeare
the sleepie groomes with blood
ile goe no more
i am afraid to thinke what i haue done
looke ont againe i dare not
infirme of purpose
giue me the daggers the sleeping and the dead
are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood
that feares a painted deuill if he doe bleed
ile guild the faces of the groomes withall
for it must seeme their guilt

whence is that knocking
how ist with me when euery noyse appalls me

that you doe lye so late
faith sir we were carowsing till the second cock
and drinke sir is a great prouoker of three things
what three things does drinke especially
prouoke
marry sir nosepainting sleepe and vrine
lecherie sir it prouokes and vnprouokes it prouokes
the desire but it takes away the performance therefore
much drinke may be said to be an equiuocator with lecherie
it makes him and it marres him it sets him on
and it takes him off it perswades him and disheartens
him makes him stand too and not stand too in conclusion
equiuocates him in a sleepe and giuing him the lye
leaues him
i beleeue drinke gaue thee the lye last night
that it did sir ithe very throat on me but i
requited him for his lye and i thinke being too strong
for him though he tooke vp my legges sometime yet i
made a shift to cast him

strange schreemes of death

of dyre combustion and confusd euents

oh by whom
those of his chamber as it seemd had dont
their hands and faces were all badgd with blood
so were their daggers which vnwipd we found
vpon their pillowes they stard and were distracted
no mans life was to be trusted with them
o yet i doe repent me of my furie
that i did kill them
wherefore did you so
who can be wise amazd temprate  furious
loyall and neutrall in a moment no man

outrun the pawser reason here lay duncan
his siluer skinne lacd with his golden blood
and his gashd stabs lookd like a breach in nature

courage to makes loue knowne
helpe me hence hoa

why doe we hold our tongues

our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer
where we are theres daggers in mens smiles
the neere in blood the neerer bloody
this murtherous shaft thats shot
hath not yet lighted and our safest way
is to auoid the ayme therefore to horse
and let vs not be daintie of leauetaking
but shift away theres warrant in that theft
which steales it selfe when theres no mercie left
threescore and ten i can remember well
within the volume of which time i haue seene
houres dreadfull and things strange but this sore night
hath trifled former knowings
ha good father
thou seest the heauens as troubled with mans act
threatens his bloody stage byth clock tis day
and yet darke night strangles the trauailing lampe
ist nights predominance or the dayes shame

euen like the deed thats done on tuesday last
a faulcon towring in her pride of place
was by a mowsing owle hawkt at and killd
and duncans horses
a thing most strange and certaine
beauteous and swift the minions of their race
turnd wilde in nature broke their stalls flong out
contending gainst obedience as they would
make warre with mankinde
tis said they eate each other
they did so
to th amazement of mine eyes that lookd vpont
enter macduffe
why see you not
ist known who did this more then bloody deed
those that macbeth hath slaine
alas the day
what good could they pretend
they were subborned
malcolme and donalbaine the kings two sonnes
are stolne away and fled which puts vpon them
suspition of the deed
gainst nature still
thriftlesse ambition that will rauen vp
thine owne liues meanes then tis most like
the soueraignty will fall vpon macbeth
he is already namd and gone to scone
to be inuested
where is duncans body
carried to colmekill
the sacred storehouse of his predecessors
and guardian of their bones
will you to scone
no cosin ile to fife
well i will thither
well may you see things wel done there adieu
least our old robes sit easier then our new
farewell father
gods benyson go with you and with those
that would make good of bad and friends of foes
thou hast it now king cawdor glamis all
as the weyard women promisd and i feare
thou playdst most fowly fort yet it was saide
it should not stand in thy posterity
but that my selfe should be the roote and father
of many kings if there come truth from them
as vpon thee macbeth their speeches shine
why by the verities on thee made good
may they not be my oracles as well
and set me vp in hope but hush no more
heeres our chiefe guest
if he had beene forgotten
it had bene as a gap in our great feast
and allthing vnbecomming
to night we hold a solemne supper sir
and ile request your presence
let your highnesse
command vpon me to the which my duties
are with a most indissoluble tye
for euer knit
ride you this afternoone
i my good lord
we should haue else desird your good aduice
which still hath been both graue and prosperous
in this dayes councell but weele take to morrow
ist farre you ride
as farre my lord as will fill vp the time
twixt this and supper goe not my horse the better
i must become a borrower of the night
for a darke houre or twaine
faile not our feast
my lord i will not
we heare our bloody cozens are bestowd
in england and in ireland not confessing
their cruell parricide filling their hearers
with strange inuention but of that to morrow
when therewithall we shall haue cause of state
crauing vs ioyntly hye you to horse
adieu till you returne at night
goes fleance with you
i my good lord our time does call vpons
i wish your horses swift and sure of foot
and so i doe commend you to their backs
farwell
they are my lord without the pallace
gate
bring them before vs
it was so please your highnesse
well then
now haue you considerd of my speeches
know that it was he in the times past
which held you so vnder fortune
which you thought had been our innocent selfe
this i made good to you in our last conference
past in probation with you
how you were borne in hand how crost
the instruments who wrought with them
and all things else that might
to halfe a soule and to a notion crazd
say thus did banquo
you made it knowne to vs
i did so
and went further which is now
our point of second meeting
doe you finde your patience so predominant
in your nature that you can let this goe
are you so gospelld to pray for this good man
and for his issue whose heauie hand
hath bowd you to the graue and beggerd
yours for euer
we are men my liege
i in the catalogue ye goe for men
as hounds and greyhounds mungrels spaniels curres
showghes waterrugs and demywolues are clipt
all by the name of dogges the valued file
distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
the housekeeper the hunter euery one
according to the gift which bounteous nature
hath in him closd whereby he does receiue
particular addition from the bill
that writes them all alike and so of men
now if you haue a station in the file
not ith worst ranke of manhood sayt
and i will put that businesse in your bosomes
whose execution takes your enemie off
grapples you to the heart and loue of vs
who weare our health but sickly in his life
which in his death were perfect
i am one my liege
whom the vile blowes and buffets of the world
hath so incensd that i am recklesse what i doe
to spight the world
and i another
so wearie with disasters tuggd with fortune
that i would set my life on any chance
to mend it or be rid ont
both of you know banquo was your enemie
true my lord
so is he mine and in such bloody distance
that euery minute of his being thrusts
against my neerst of life and though i could
with barefacd power sweepe him from my sight
and bid my will auouch it yet i must not
for certaine friends that are both his and mine
whose loues i may not drop but wayle his fall
who i my selfe struck downe and thence it is
that i to your assistance doe make loue
masking the businesse from the common eye
for sundry weightie reasons
we shall my lord
performe what you command vs
though our liues
your spirits shine through you
within this houre at most
i will aduise you where to plant your selues
acquaint you with the perfect spy oth time
the moment ont fort must be done to night
and something from the pallace alwayes thought
that i require a clearenesse and with him
to leaue no rubs nor botches in the worke
fleans  his sonne that keepes him companie
whose absence is no lesse materiall to me
then is his fathers must embrace the fate
of that darke houre resolue your selues apart
ile come to you anon
we are resolud my lord
ile call vpon you straight abide within
it is concluded banquo thy soules flight
if it finde heauen must finde it out to night
is banquo gone from court
i madame but returnes againe to night
say to the king i would attend his leysure
for a few words
madame i will
enter
noughts had alls spent
where our desire is got without content
tis safer to be that which we destroy
then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy
enter macbeth
we haue scorchd the snake not killd it
sheele close and be her selfe whilest our poore mallice
remaines in danger of her former tooth
but let the frame of things disioynt
both the worlds suffer
ere we will eate our meale in feare and sleepe
in the affliction of these terrible dreames
that shake vs nightly better be with the dead
whom we to gayne our peace haue sent to peace
then on the torture of the minde to lye
in restlesse extasie
duncane is in his graue
after lifes fitfull feuer he sleepes well
treason has done his worst nor steele nor poyson
mallice domestique forraine leuie nothing
can touch him further
come on
gentle my lord sleeke ore your rugged lookes
be bright and iouiall among your guests to night
so shall i loue and so i pray be you
let your remembrance apply to banquo
present him eminence both with eye and tongue
vnsafe the while that wee must laue
our honors in these flattering streames
and make our faces vizards to our hearts
disguising what they are
you must leaue this
o full of scorpions is my minde deare wife
thou knowst that banquo and his fleans liues
but in them natures coppies not eterne
theres comfort yet they are assaileable
then be thou iocund ere the bat hath flowne
his cloysterd flight ere to black heccats summons
the shardborne beetle with his drowsie hums
hath rung nights yawning peale
there shall be done a deed of dreadfull note
whats to be done
be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
till thou applaud the deed come seeling night
skarfe vp the tender eye of pittifull day
and with thy bloodie and inuisible hand
cancell and teare to pieces that great bond
which keepes me pale light thickens
and the crow makes wing toth rookie wood
good things of day begin to droope and drowse
whiles nights black agents to their preys doe rowse
thou maruellst at my words but hold thee still
things bad begun make strong themselues by ill
so prythee goe with me
but who did bid thee ioyne with vs
macbeth
he needes not our mistrust since he deliuers
our offices and what we haue to doe
to the direction iust
then stand with vs
the west yet glimmers with some streakes of day
now spurres the lated traueller apace
to gayne the timely inne and neere approches
the subiect of our watch
hearke i heare horses

as broad and generall as the casing ayre
but now i am cabind cribd confind bound in

with twenty trenched gashes on his head

weel heare our selues againe
my royall lord

and health on both
mayt please your highnesse sit

and hath beene from his youth pray you keepe seat
the fit is momentary vpon a thought
he will againe be well if much you note him
you shall offend him and extend his passion
feed and regard him not are you a man
i and a bold one that dare looke on that
which might appall the diuell
o proper stuffe
this is the very painting of your feare
this is the ayredrawnedagger which you said
led you to duncan o these flawes and starts
impostors to true feare would well become
a womans story at a winters fire
authorizd by her grandam shame it selfe
why do you make such faces when alls done
you looke but on a stoole
prythee see there
behold looke loe how say you
why what care i if thou canst nod speake too
if charnell houses and our graues must send
those that we bury backe our monuments

if i stand heere i saw him
fie for shame
blood hath bene shed ere now ith olden time
ere humane statute purgd the gentle weale
i and since too murthers haue bene performd
too terrible for the eare the times has bene
that when the braines were out the man would dye
and there an end but now they rise againe
with twenty mortall murthers on their crownes
and push vs from our stooles this is more strange
then such a murther is
my worthy lord
your noble friends do lacke you

i haue a strange infirmity which is nothing
to those that know me come loue and health to all
then ile sit downe giue me some wine fill full

auant  quit my sight let the earth hide thee
thy bones are marrowlesse thy blood is cold
thou hast no speculation in those eyes
which thou dost glare with
thinke of this good peeres
but as a thing of custome tis no other
onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time
what man dare i dare
approach thou like the rugged russian beare
the armd rhinoceros or th hircan tiger
take any shape but that and my firme nerues
shall neuer tremble or be aliue againe
and dare me to the desart with thy sword
if trembling i inhabit then protest mee
the baby of a girle hence horrible shadow
vnreall mockry hence why so being gone
i am a man againe pray you sit still
you haue displacd the mirth
broke the good meeting with most admird disorder
can such things be
and ouercome vs like a summers clowd
without our speciall wonder you make me strange
euen to the disposition that i owe
when now i thinke you can behold such sights
and keepe the naturall rubie of your cheekes
when mine is blanchd with feare
what sights my lord
i pray you speake not he growes worse  worse
question enrages him at once goodnight
stand not vpon the order of your going
but go at once
good night and better health
attend his maiesty
a kinde goodnight to all
it will haue blood they say
blood will haue blood
stones haue beene knowne to moue  trees to speake
augures and vnderstood relations haue
by maggot pyes  choughes  rookes brought forth
the secretst man of blood what is the night
almost at oddes with morning which is which
how sayst thou that macduff denies his person
at our great bidding
did you send to him sir
i heare it by the way but i will send
theres not a one of them but in his house
i keepe a seruant feed i will to morrow
and betimes i will to the weyard sisters
more shall they speake for now i am bent to know
by the worst meanes the worst for mine owne good
all causes shall giue way i am in blood
stept in so farre that should i wade no more
returning were as tedious as go ore
strange things i haue in head that will to hand
which must be acted ere they may be scand
you lacke the season of all natures sleepe
come weel to sleepe my strange  selfabuse
is the initiate feare that wants hard vse
we are yet but yong indeed
why how now hecat you looke angerly
haue i not reason beldams as you are
sawcy and ouerbold how did you dare
to trade and trafficke with macbeth
in riddles and affaires of death
and i the mistris of your charmes
the close contriuer of all harmes
was neuer calld to beare my part
or shew the glory of our art
and which is worse all you haue done
hath bene but for a wayward sonne
spightfull and wrathfull who as others do
loues for his owne ends not for you
but make amends now get you gon
and at the pit of acheron
meete me ith morning thither he
will come to know his destinie
your vessels and your spels prouide
your charmes and euery thing beside
i am for th ayre this night ile spend
vnto a dismall and a fatall end
great businesse must be wrought ere noone
vpon the corner of the moone
there hangs a vaprous drop profound
ile catch it ere it come to ground
and that distilld by magicke slights
shall raise such artificiall sprights
as by the strength of their illusion
shall draw him on to his confusion
he shall spurne fate scorne death and beare
his hopes boue wisedome grace and feare
and you all know security
is mortals cheefest enemie
come lets make hast sheel soone be
backe againe
my former speeches
haue but hit your thoughts
which can interpret farther onely i say
things haue bin strangely borne the gracious duncan
was pittied of macbeth marry he was dead
and the right valiant banquo walkd too late
whom you may say ift please you fleans killd
for fleans fled men must not walke too late
who cannot want the thought how monstrous
it was for malcolme and for donalbane
to kill their gracious father damned fact
how it did greeue macbeth did he not straight
in pious rage the two delinquents teare
that were the slaues of drinke and thralles of sleepe
was not that nobly done i and wisely too
for twould haue angerd any heart aliue
to heare the men denyt so that i say
he has borne all things well and i do thinke
that had he duncans sonnes vnder his key
as andt please heauen he shall not they should finde
what twere to kill a father so should fleans
but peace for from broad words and cause he fayld
his presence at the tyrants feast i heare
macduffe liues in disgrace sir can you tell
where he bestowes himselfe
the sonnes of duncane
from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
liues in the english court and is receyud
of the most pious edward with such grace
that the maleuolence of fortune nothing
takes from his high respect thither macduffe
is gone to pray the holy king vpon his ayd
to wake northumberland and warlike seyward
that by the helpe of these with him aboue
to ratifie the worke we may againe
giue to our tables meate sleepe to our nights
free from our feasts and banquets bloody kniues
do faithfull homage and receiue free honors
all which we pine for now and this report
hath so exasperate their king that hee
prepares for some attempt of warre
sent he to macduffe
he did and with an absolute sir not i
the clowdy messenger turnes me his backe
and hums as who should say youl rue the time
that clogges me with this answer
and that well might
aduise him to a caution t hold what distance
his wisedome can prouide some holy angell
flye to the court of england and vnfold
his message ere he come that a swift blessing
may soone returne to this our suffering country
vnder a hand accursd
ile send my prayers with him
thrice the brinded cat hath mewd
thrice and once the hedgepigge whind

enter lenox
whats your graces will
saw you the weyard sisters

and damnd all those that trust them i did heare
the gallopping of horse who wast came by
tis two or three my lord that bring you word
macduff is fled to england
fled to england
i my good lord
time thou anticipatst my dread exploits
the flighty purpose neuer is oretooke
vnlesse the deed go with it from this moment
the very firstlings of my heart shall be
the firstlings of my hand and euen now
to crown my thoughts with acts be it thoght  done
the castle of macduff i will surprize
seize vpon fife giue to th edge oth sword
his wife his babes and all vnfortunate soules
that trace him in his line no boasting like a foole
this deed ile do before this purpose coole
but no more sights where are these gentlemen
come bring me where they are
what had he done to make him fly the land
you must haue patience madam
he had none
his flight was madnesse when our actions do not
our feares do make vs traitors
you know not
whether it was his wisedome or his feare
wisedom to leaue his wife to leaue his babes
his mansion and his titles in a place
from whence himselfe dos flye he loues vs not
he wants the naturall touch for the poore wren
the most diminitiue of birds will fight
her yong ones in her nest against the owle
all is the feare and nothing is the loue
as little is the wisedome where the flight
so runnes against all reason
my deerest cooz
i pray you schoole your selfe but for your husband
he is noble wise iudicious and best knowes
the fits oth season i dare not speake much further
but cruell are the times when we are traitors
and do not know our selues when we hold rumor
from what we feare yet know not what we feare
but floate vpon a wilde and violent sea
each way and moue i take my leaue of you
shall not be long but ile be heere againe
things at the worst will cease or else climbe vpward
to what they were before my pretty cosine
blessing vpon you
fatherd he is
and yet hees fatherlesse
i am so much a foole should i stay longer
it would be my disgrace and your discomfort
i take my leaue at once
sirra your fathers dead
and what will you do now how will you liue
as birds do mother
what with wormes and flyes
with what i get i meane and so do they
poore bird
thoudst neuer feare the net nor lime
the pitfall nor the gin
why should i mother
poore birds they are not set for
my father is not dead for all your saying
yes he is dead
how wilt thou do for a father
nay how will you do for a husband
why i can buy me twenty at any market
then youl by em to sell againe
thou speakst withall thy wit
and yet ifaith with wit enough for thee
was my father a traitor mother
i that he was
what is a traitor
why one that sweares and lyes
and be all traitors that do so
euery one that dos so is a traitor
and must be hangd
and must they all be hangd that swear and lye
euery one
who must hang them
why the honest men
then the liars and swearers are fools for there
are lyars and swearers enow to beate the honest men
and hang vp them
now god helpe thee poore monkie
but how wilt thou do for a father
if he were dead yould weepe for him if you
would not it were a good signe that i should quickely
haue a new father
poore pratler how thou talkst
enter a messenger
blesse you faire dame i am not to you known
though in your state of honor i am perfect
i doubt some danger dos approach you neerely
if you will take a homely mans aduice
be not found heere hence with your little ones
to fright you thus me thinkes i am too sauage
to do worse to you were fell cruelty
which is too nie your person heauen preserue you
i dare abide no longer
whether should i flye
i haue done no harme but i remember now
i am in this earthly world where to do harme
is often laudable to do good sometime
accounted dangerous folly why then alas
do i put vp that womanly defence
to say i haue done no harme
what are these faces
enter murtherers
where is your husband
i hope in no place so vnsanctified
where such as thou mayst finde him
hes a traitor
thou lyst thou shaggeeard villaine
what you egge
yong fry of treachery
he has killd me mother
run away i pray you
let vs seeke out some desolate shade  there
weepe our sad bosomes empty
let vs rather
hold fast the mortall sword and like good men
bestride our downfall birthdome each new morne
new widdowes howle new orphans cry new sorowes
strike heauen on the face that it resounds
as if it felt with scotland and yelld out
like syllable of dolour
what i beleeue ile waile
what know beleeue and what i can redresse
as i shall finde the time to friend i wil
what you haue spoke it may be so perchance
this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
was once thought honest you haue loud him well
he hath not touchd you yet i am yong but something
you may discerne of him through me and wisedome
to offer vp a weake poore innocent lambe
t appease an angry god
i am not treacherous
but macbeth is
a good and vertuous nature may recoyle
in an imperiall charge but i shall craue your pardon
that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
angels are bright still though the brightest fell
though all things foule would wear the brows of grace
yet grace must still looke so
i haue lost my hopes
perchance euen there
where i did finde my doubts
why in that rawnesse left you wife and childe
those precious motiues those strong knots of loue
without leauetaking i pray you
let not my iealousies be your dishonors
but mine owne safeties you may be rightly iust
what euer i shall thinke
bleed bleed poore country
great tyrrany lay thou thy basis sure
for goodnesse dare not check thee wear y thy wrongs
the title is affeard far thee well lord
i would not be the villaine that thou thinkst
for the whole space thats in the tyrants graspe
and the rich east to boot
be not offended
i speake not as in absolute feare of you
i thinke our country sinkes beneath the yoake
it weepes it bleeds and each new day a gash
is added to her wounds i thinke withall
there would be hands vplifted in my right
and heere from gracious england haue i offer
of goodly thousands but for all this
when i shall treade vpon the tyrants head
or weare it on my sword yet my poore country
shall haue more vices then it had before
more suffer and more sundry wayes then euer
by him that shall succeede
what should he be
it is my selfe i meane in whom i know
all the particulars of vice so grafted
that when they shall be opend blacke macbeth
will seeme as pure as snow and the poore state
esteeme him as a lambe being compard
with my confinelesse harmes
not in the legions
of horrid hell can come a diuell more damnd
in euils to top macbeth
i grant him bloody
luxurious auaricious false deceitfull
sodaine malicious smacking of euery sinne
that has a name but theres no bottome none
in my voluptuousnesse your wiues your daughters
your matrons and your maides could not fill vp
the cesterne of my lust and my desire
all continent impediments would orebeare
that did oppose my will better macbeth
then such an one to reigne
boundlesse intemperance
in nature is a tyranny it hath beene
th vntimely emptying of the happy throne
and fall of many kings but feare not yet
to take vpon you what is yours you may
conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
and yet seeme cold the time you may so hoodwinke
we haue willing dames enough there cannot be
that vulture in you to deuoure so many
as will to greatnesse dedicate themselues
finding it so inclinde
with this there growes
in my most illcomposd affection such
a stanchlesse auarice that were i king
i should cut off the nobles for their lands
desire his iewels and this others house
and my morehauing would be as a sawce
to make me hunger more that i should forge
quarrels vniust against the good and loyall
destroying them for wealth
this auarice
stickes deeper growes with more pernicious roote
then summerseeming lust and it hath bin
the sword of our slaine kings yet do not feare
scotland hath foysons to fill vp your will
of your meere owne all these are portable
with other graces weighd
but i haue noneas iustice verity temprance stablenesse
bounty perseuerance mercy lowlinesse
deuotion patience courage fortitude
i haue no rellish of them but abound
in the diuision of each seuerall crime
acting it many wayes nay had i powre i should
poure the sweet milke of concord into hell
vprore the vniuersall peace confound
all vnity on earth
o scotland scotland
if such a one be fit to gouerne speake
i am as i haue spoken
fit to gouern no not to liuewith an vntitled tyrant bloody sceptred
when shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe
since that the truest issue of thy throne
by his owne interdiction stands accust
and dos blaspheme his breed thy royall father
was a most saintedking the queene that bore thee
oftner vpon her knees then on her feet
dyde euery day she liud fare thee well
these euils thou repeatst vpon thy selfe
hath banishd me from scotland o my brest
thy hope ends heere
macduff this noble passion
childe of integrity hath from my soule
wipd the blacke scruples reconcild my thoughts
to thy good truth and honor diuellish macbeth
by many of these traines hath sought to win me
into his power and modest wisedome pluckes me
from ouercredulous hast but god aboue
deale betweene thee and me for euen now
i put my selfe to thy direction and
vnspeake mine owne detraction heere abiure
the taints and blames i laide vpon my selfe
for strangers to my nature i am yet
vnknowne to woman neuer was forsworne
scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne
at no time broke my faith would not betray
the deuill to his fellow and delight
no lesse in truth then life my first false speaking
was this vpon my selfe what i am truly
is thine and my poore countries to command
whither indeed before they heere approach
old seyward with ten thousand warlike men
already at a point was setting foorth
now weel together and the chance of goodnesse
be like our warranted quarrell why are you silent
such welcome and vnwelcom things at once
tis hard to reconcile
enter a doctor

tis calld the euill
a most myraculous worke in this good king
which often since my heere remaine in england
i haue seene him do how he solicites heauen
himselfe best knowes but strangely visited people
all swolne and vlcerous pittifull to the eye
the meere dispaire of surgery he cures
hanging a golden stampe about their neckes
put on with holy prayers and tis spoken
to the succeeding royalty he leaues
the healing benediction with this strange vertue
he hath a heauenly guift of prophesie
and sundry blessings hang about his throne
that speake him full of grace
enter rosse
see who comes heere
my countryman but yet i know him not
my euer gentle cozen welcome hither
i know him nowthe meanes that makes vs strangers
sir amen
stands scotland where it did
alas poore countrey
almost affraid to know it selfe it cannot
be calld our mother but our graue where nothing
but who knowes nothing is once seene to smile
where sighes and groanes and shrieks that rent the ayre
are made not markd where violent sorrow seemes
a moderne extasie the deadmans knell
is there scarse askd for who and good mens liues
expire before the flowers in their caps
dying or ere they sicken
oh relation too nice and yet too true
whats the newest griefe
that of an houres age doth hisse the speaker
each minute teemes a new one
how dos my wife
why well
and all my children
well too
the tyrant has not batterd at their peace
no they were wel at peace when i did leaue em
be not a niggard of your speech how gost
when i came hither to transport the tydings
which i haue heauily borne there ran a rumour
of many worthy fellowes that were out
which was to my beleefe witnest the rather
for that i saw the tyrants power afoot
now is the time of helpe your eye in scotland
would create soldiours make our women fight
to doffe their dire distresses
beet their comfort
we are comming thither gracious england hath
lent vs good seyward and ten thousand men
an older and a better souldier none
that christendome giues out
would i could answer
this comfort with the like but i haue words
that would be howld out in the desert ayre
where hearing should not latch them
what concerne they
the generall cause or is it a feegriefe
due to some single brest
no minde thats honest
but in it shares some woe though the maine part
pertaines to you alone
if it be mine
keepe it not from me quickly let me haue it
let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer
which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound
that euer yet they heard
humh i guesse at it

sauagely slaughterd to relate the manner
were on the quarry of these murtherd deere
to adde the death of you
mercifull heauen
what man nere pull your hat vpon your browes
giue sorrow words the griefe that dos not speake
whispers the orefraught heart and bids it breake

to cure this deadly greefe

what all my pretty chickens and their damme

but i must also feele it as a man
i cannot but remember such things were
that were most precious to me did heauen looke on
and would not take their part sinfull macduff
they were all strooke for thee naught that i am
not for their owne demerits but for mine
fell slaughter on their soules heauen rest them now
be this the whetstone of your sword let griefe
conuert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
o i could play the woman with mine eyes
and braggart with my tongue but gentle heauens
cut short all intermission front to front
bring thou this fiend of scotland and my selfe
within my swords length set him if he scape
heauen forgiue him too

in this slumbry agitation besides her walking and other
actuall performances what at any time haue you heard
her say

great dunsinane he strongly fortifies
some say hees mad others that lesser hate him
do call it valiant fury but for certaine
he cannot buckle his distemperd cause
within the belt of rule
now dos he feele
his secret murthers sticking on his hands
now minutely reuolts vpbraid his faithbreach
those he commands moue onely in command
nothing in loue now dos he feele his title
hang loose about him like a giants robe
vpon a dwarfish theefe
who then shall blame
his pesterd senses to recoyle and start
when all that is within him dos condemne
it selfe for being there
well march we on
to giue obedience where tis truly owd
meet we the medcine of the sickly weale
and with him poure we in our countries purge
each drop of vs

to dew the soueraigne flower and drowne the weeds
make we our march towards birnan
bring me no more reports let them flye all
till byrnane wood remoue to dunsinane

was he not borne of woman the spirits that know
all mortall consequences haue pronouncd me thus

plucke from the memory a rooted sorrow
raze out the written troubles of the braine
and with some sweet obliuious antidote

that should applaud againe pullt off i say
what rubarb cyme or what purgatiue drugge
would scowre these english hence hearst y of them
i my good lord your royall preparation
makes vs heare something
bring it after me
i will not be affraid of death and bane
till birnane forrest come to dunsinane
were i from dunsinane away and cleere
profit againe should hardly draw me heere
cosins i hope the dayes are neere at hand
that chambers will be safe
we doubt it nothing
what wood is this before vs
the wood of birnane
let euery souldier hew him downe a bough
and beart before him thereby shall we shadow
the numbers of our hoast and make discouery
erre in report of vs
it shall be done
we learne no other but the confident tyrant
keepes still in dunsinane and will indure
our setting downe befort
tis his maine hope
for where there is aduantage to be giuen
both more and lesse haue giuen him the reuolt
and none serue with him but constrained things
whose hearts are absent too
let our iust censures
attend the true euent and put we on
industrious souldiership
the time approaches
that will with due decision make vs know
what we shall say we haue and what we owe
thoughts speculatiue their vnsure hopes relate
but certaine issue stroakes must arbitrate
towards which aduance the warre
hang out our banners on the outward walls
the cry is still they come our castles strength
will laugh a siedge to scorne heere let them lye
till famine and the ague eate them vp
were they not forcd with those that should be ours
we might haue met them darefull beard to beard
and beate them backward home what is that noyse
it is the cry of women my good lord
i haue almost forgot the taste of feares
the time has beene my sences would haue coold
to heare a nightshrieke and my fell of haire
would at a dismall treatise rowze and stirre
as life were int i haue supt full with horrors
direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
cannot once start me wherefore was that cry
the queene my lord is dead
she should haue dyde heereafter
there would haue beene a time for such a word
to morrow and to morrow and to morrow
creepes in this petty pace from day to day
to the last syllable of recorded time
and all our yesterdayes haue lighted fooles
the way to dusty death out out breefe candle
lifes but a walking shadow a poore player
that struts and frets his houre vpon the stage
and then is heard no more it is a tale
told by an ideot full of sound and fury
signifying nothing
enter a messenger
gracious my lord
i should report that which i say i saw
but know not how to doot
well say sir
as i did stand my watch vpon the hill
i lookd toward byrnane and anon me thought
the wood began to moue
lyar and slaue
let me endure your wrath ift be not so
within this three mile may you see it comming
i say a mouing groue
if thou speakst false
vpon the next tree shall thou hang aliue
till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
i care not if thou dost for me as much
i pull in resolution and begin
to doubt th equiuocation of the fiend
that lies like truth feare not till byrnane wood
do come to dunsinane and now a wood
comes toward dunsinane arme arme and out
if this which he auouches dos appeare
there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
i ginne to be aweary of the sun
and wish th estate oth world were now vndon
ring the alarum bell blow winde come wracke
at least weel dye with harnesse on our backe
now neere enough
your leauy skreenes throw downe
and shew like those you are you worthy vnkle
shall with my cosin your right noble sonne
leade our first battell worthy macduffe and wee
shall take vpons what else remaines to do
according to our order
fare you well
do we but finde the tyrants power to night
let vs be beaten if we cannot fight
make all our trumpets speak giue them all breath
those clamorous harbingers of blood  death
they haue tied me to a stake i cannot flye
but bearelike i must fight the course whats he
that was not borne of woman such a one
am i to feare or none
enter young seyward
what is thy name
thoult be affraid to heare it
no though thou callst thy selfe a hoter name
then any is in hell
my names macbeth
the diuell himselfe could not pronounce a title
more hatefull to mine eare
no nor more fearefull
thou lyest abhorred tyrant with my sword
ile proue the lye thou speakst
thou wast borne of woman
but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorne
brandishd by man thats of a woman borne
enter
that way the noise is tyrant shew thy face
if thou beest slaine and with no stroake of mine
my wife and childrens ghosts will haunt me still
i cannot strike at wretched kernes whose armes
are hyrd to beare their staues either thou macbeth
or else my sword with an vnbattered edge
i sheath againe vndeeded there thou shouldst be
by this great clatter one of greatest note
seemes bruited let me finde him fortune
and more i begge not
this way my lord the castles gently rendred
the tyrants people on both sides do fight
the noble thanes do brauely in the warre
the day almost it selfe professes yours
and little is to do
we haue met with foes
that strike beside vs
enter sir the castle
why should i play the roman foole and dye
on mine owne sword whiles i see liues the gashes
do better vpon them
enter macduffe
turne hellhound turne
of all men else i haue auoyded thee
but get thee backe my soule is too much chargd
with blood of thine already
i haue no words
my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villaine
then tearmes can giue thee out
thou loosest labour
as easie mayst thou the intrenchant ayre
with thy keene sword impresse as make me bleed
let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
i beare a charmed life which must not yeeld
to one of woman borne
dispaire thy charme
and let the angell whom thou still hast serud
tell thee macduffe was from his mothers womb
vntimely ript
accursed be that tongue that tels mee so
for it hath cowd my better part of man
and be these iugling fiends no more beleeud
that palter with vs in a double sence
that keepe the word of promise to our eare
and breake it to our hope ile not fight with thee
then yeeld thee coward
and liue to be the shew and gaze oth time
weel haue thee as our rarer monsters are
painted vpon a pole and vnderwrit
heere may you see the tyrant
i will not yeeld
to kisse the ground before young malcolmes feet
and to be baited with the rabbles curse
though byrnane wood be come to dunsinane
and thou opposd being of no woman borne
yet i will try the last before my body
i throw my warlike shield lay on macduffe
and damnd be him that first cries hold enough
i would the friends we misse were safe arriud
some must go off and yet by these i see
so great a day as this is cheapely bought
macduffe is missing and your noble sonne
your son my lord has paid a souldiers debt
he onely liud but till he was a man
the which no sooner had his prowesse confirmd
in the vnshrinking station where he fought
but like a man he dyde
then he is dead
i and brought off the field your cause of sorrow
must not be measurd by his worth for then
it hath no end
had he his hurts before
i on the front
why then gods soldier be he
had i as many sonnes as i haue haires
i would not wish them to a fairer death
and so his knell is knolld
hees worth more sorrow
and that ile spend for him
hes worth no more
they say he parted well and paid his score
and so god be with him here comes newer comfort
enter macduffe with macbeths head
haile king for so thou art
behold where stands
th vsurpers cursed head the time is free
i see thee compast with thy kingdomes pearle
that speake my salutation in their minds
whose voyces i desire alowd with mine
haile king of scotland
haile king of scotland
we shall not spend a large expence of time
before we reckon with your seuerall loues
and make vs euen with you my thanes and kinsmen
henceforth be earles the first that euer scotland
in such an honor namd whats more to do
which would be planted newly with the time
as calling home our exild friends abroad
that fled the snares of watchfull tyranny
producing forth the cruell ministers
of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queene
who as tis thought by selfe and violent hands
tooke off her life this and what need full else
that calls vpon vs by the grace of grace
we will performe in measure time and place
so thankes to all at once and to each one
whom we inuite to see vs crownd at scone
