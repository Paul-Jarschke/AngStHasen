# """Task 04 â€“ HTTP Request
#
# Working with HTTP connections is essential for many data gathering tasks. The Python library urllib provides all functionality we need. Write a Python function open_url(url) that:
#
#     uses urllib to establish a HTTP connection to an arbitrary website
#     retrieves and prints the first 200 characters of the html resource, i.e. the html source code, of the chosen website
#     handles the exceptions thrown by the urllib.request function
#
# """
