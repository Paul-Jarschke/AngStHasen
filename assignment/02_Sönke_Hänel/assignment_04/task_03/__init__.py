"""Task 03 â€“ Unity Test

The following algorithm in Python converts numbers in decimal representation to binary.

    Develop a unit test that checks for values in the interval [-1,3] whether the algorithm returns the expected results.
    Adjust the algorithm, so it passes the unit test developed in 1). Rename the function to

decimal_to_binary_correct()
