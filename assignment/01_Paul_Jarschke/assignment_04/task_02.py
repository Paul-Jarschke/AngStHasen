# Task 2 - List Comprehensions

# Python supports list comprehension. The basic syntax of list comprehensions is:
# L = [<elem> for <elem> <Condition>]
# Use list comprehensions to write a Python function remove_long_words() that:
#
#   -  accepts a sentence s and an integer n as input parameters
#   -  uses the split() function of String objects to split the sentence into words
#   -  stores the individual words in a list
#   -  removes all words that are longer than n characters from the list, thereby creating a new list
#   -  prints the list to stdout

s = input('Please enter a sentence: ')
print(s)
