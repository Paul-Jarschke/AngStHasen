# Task 05 - Check Brackets
# Write a program that reads in a string, which is supposed to be a mathematical expression. Focus on brackets only and
# check whether left and right brackets are composed correctly. Ignore all other characters
# (i.e. you donâ€™t have to check correctness of operators and operands).
# Examples of correct input:
#     3*(2+5)
#     ((()())())
#     (3+)(((4)))
#     Empty string
#
# Examples of incorrect input:
#     (3*(2+5)
#     ((()())(())
#     (3+)((4)))
#     ())(()
