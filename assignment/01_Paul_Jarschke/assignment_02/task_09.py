# Task 09 - Unlimited Power II
# Using function for factorial and function xn from previous task, write a program that reads value of x and prints
# approximate value of ex. Use this formula (Taylor series) for calculation.
# To get precise value of ex, the series would have to be infinite. Suppose that there is some required accuracy, so the
# calculation finishes as soon as the value of the next element is smaller than given threshold (e.g., 0.000001).
