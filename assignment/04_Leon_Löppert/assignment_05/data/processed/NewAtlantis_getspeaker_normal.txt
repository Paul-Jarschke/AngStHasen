 are ye christians we were
 if ye will swear all of you by the
merits of the saviour that ye are no pirates nor have shed blood
lawfully nor unlawfully within forty days past you may have licence
to come on land we were all ready to take that oath
 my lord would
have you know that it is not of pride or greatness that he cometh
not aboard your ship but for that in your answer you declare that you
have many sick amongst you he was warned by the conservator of health
of the city that he should keep a distance
 we were his humble servants and accounted
for great honour and singular humanity towards us that which was
already done but hoped well that the nature of the sickness of our
men was not infectious
 by the name of jesus and his merits
 he must not be twice paid for one labour
 he came to conduct us to the
strangers house and that he had prevented the hour because we might
have the whole day before us for our business  for if
you will follow my advice there shall first go with me some few of
you and see the place and how it may be made convenient for you and
then you may send for your sick and the rest of your number which ye
will bring on land that this care which
he took of desolate strangers god would reward
 he was but our servant and our guide
 what number of
persons we were  and how many sick we were in all
sick and whole one and fifty persons whereof our sick were
seventeen
 
then he led us to a long gallery like a dorture where he showed us
all along the one side for the other side was but wall and window
seventeen cells very neat ones having partitions of cedar wood
which gallery and cells being in all forty many more than we needed
 were instituted as an infirmary for sick persons  and he told us
withal that as any of our sick waxed well he might be removed from
his cell to a chamber for which purpose there were set forth ten
spare chambers besides the number we spake of before  this done he
brought us back to the parlour and lifting up his cane a little as
they do when they give any charge or command said to us 
   we gave him thanks with all affection and respect and said
   we offered him also twenty
pistolets but he smiled and only said   and so
he left us

soon after our dinner was served in which was right good viands both
for bread and treat better than any collegiate diet that i have
known in europe  we had also drink of three sorts all wholesome and
good wine of the grape a drink of grain such as is with us our ale
but more clear and a kind of cider made of a fruit of that country a
wonderful pleasing and refreshing drink  besides there were brought
in to us great store of those scarlet oranges for our sick which
they said were an assured remedy for sickness taken at sea  there
was given us also a box of small gray or whitish pills which they
wished our sick should take one of the pills every night before
sleep which they said would hasten their recovery

the next day after that our trouble of carriage and removing of our
men and goods out of our ship was somewhat settled and quiet i
thought good to call our company together and when they were
assembled said unto them 
  and if they find them bad
to banish us straightways if good to give us further time  for
these men that they have given us for attendance may withal have an
eye upon us  therefore for gods love and as we love the weal of our
souls and bodies let us so behave ourselves as we may be at peace
with god and may find grace in the eyes of this people
 i am by office governor of this house of strangers and by
vocation i am a christian priest and therefore am come to you to
offer you my service both as strangers and chiefly as christians
some things i may tell you which i think you will not be unwilling to
hear  the state hath given you license to stay on land for the space
of six weeks and let it not trouble you if your occasions ask
further time for the law in this point is not precise and i do not
doubt but my self shall be able to obtain for you such further time
as may be convenient  ye shall also understand that the strangers
house is at this time rich and much aforehand for it hath laid up
revenue these thirtyseven years for so long it is since any stranger
arrived in this part and therefore take ye no care the state will
defray you all the time you stay neither shall you stay one day the
less for that  as for any merchandise ye have brought ye shall be
well used and have your return either in merchandise or in gold and
silver for to us it is all one  and if you have any other request to
make hide it not  for ye shall find we will not make your
countenance to fall by the answer ye shall receive  only this i must
tell you that none of you must go above a karan
 from the walls of the city without especial
leave
 that we could not tell what to
say for we wanted words to express our thanks and his noble free
offers left us nothing to ask  it seemed to us that we had before us
a picture of our salvation in heaven for we that were a while since
in the jaws of death were now brought into a place where we found
nothing but consolations  for the commandment laid upon us we would
not fail to obey it though it was impossible but our hearts should be
enflamed to tread further upon this happy and holy ground
 that our tongues should first cleave to the roofs of our mouths ere
we should forget either his reverend person or this whole nation in
our prayers
 he was a priest and looked for a priests reward
which was our brotherly love and the good of our souls and bodies
 that we were come into a land of angels which did appear to us daily
and prevent us with comforts which we thought not of much less
expected
 that he was come to visit us
  we of this island of
bensalem have this that
by means of our solitary situation and of the laws of secrecy which
we have for our travellers and our rare admission of strangers we
know well most part of the habitable world and are ourselves unknown
therefore because he that knoweth least is fittest to ask questions
it is more reason for the entertainment of the time that ye ask me
questions than that i ask you
 that we humbly thanked him that he would give us leave
so to do and that we conceived by the taste we had already that
there was no worldly thing on earth more worthy to be known than the
state of that happy land  but above all since that we
were met from the several ends of the world and hoped assuredly that
we should meet one day in the kingdom of heaven for that we were
both parts christians we desired to know in respect that land was
so remote and so divided by vast and unknown seas from the land
where our saviour walked on earth who was the apostle of that nation
and how it was converted to the faith
 ye knit my
heart to you by asking this question in the first place for it
sheweth that you first seek the kingdom o f heaven and i shall gladly
and briefly satisfy your demand

 `lord god of heaven and earth thou hast vouchsafed of thy grace to
those of our order to know thy works of creation and the secrets of
them and to discern as far as appertaineth to the generations o f
men between divine miracles works of nature works of art and
impostures and illusions of all sorts  i do here acknowledge and
testify before this people that the thing which we now see before our
eyes is thy finger and a true miracle  and forasmuch as we learn in
our books that thou never workest miracles but to d divine and
excellent end for the laws o f nature are thine own laws and thou
exceedest them not but upon great cause we most humbly beseech thee
to prosper this great sign and to give us the interpretation and use
of it in mercy which thou dost in some part secretly promise by
sending it unto us

 `i bartholomew a servant of the highest and apostle of jesus
christ was warned by an angel that appeareth to me in a vision of
glory that i should commit this ark to the floods of the sea
therefore i do testify and declare unto that people where god shall
ordain this ark to come to land that in the same day is come unto
them salvation and peace and goodwill from the father and from the
lord jesus

   and here
he paused and a messenger came and called him from us  so this was
all that passed in that conference

the next day the same governor came again to us immediately after
dinner and excused himself saying 
 
we answered 
   he bowed himself a little to us and after we
were set again he said  

one of our number said after a little pause that there was a matter
we were no less desirous to know than fearful to ask lest we might
presume too far  but encouraged by his rare humanity towards us
that could scarce think ourselves strangers being his vowed and
professed servants we would take the hardiness to propound it
humbly beseeching him if he thought it not fit to be answered that
he would pardon it though he rejected it  we said 
 

at this speech the governor gave a gracious smile and said 
   it was answered by us all in all
possible humbleness but yet with a countenance taking knowledge that
we knew that he spake it but merrily 
  but because we remembered he had given a touch in
his former speech that this land had laws of secrecy touching
strangers you remember it aright and therefore in
that i shall say to you i must reserve some particulars which it is
not lawful for me to reveal but there will be enough left to give
you satisfaction

 at that time this land was known and frequented by the ships and
vessels of all the nations before named  and as it cometh to pass
they had many times men of other countries that were no sailors that
came with them as persians chaldeans arabians so as almost all
nations of might and fame resorted hither of whom we have some stirps
and little tribes with us at this day  and for our own ships they
went sundry voyages as well to your straits which you call the
pillars of hercules as to other parts in the atlantic and mediterrane
seas as to paguin which is the same with cambaline and quinzy
upon the oriental seas as far as to the borders of the east tartary

  there and of the magnificent temple palace city
and hill and the manifold streams of goodly navigable rivers which
as so many chains environed the same site and temple and the several
degrees of ascent whereby men did climb up to the same as if it had
been a scala coeli be all poetical and fabulous yet so much is true
that the said country of atlantis as well that of peru then called
coya as that of mexico then named tyrambel were mighty and proud
kingdoms in arms shipping and riches so mighty as at one time or
at least within the space of ten years they both made two great
expeditions they of tyrambel through the atlantic to the mediterrane
sea and they of coya through the south sea upon this our island and
for the former of these which was into europe the same author
amongst you as it seemeth had some relation from the egyptian priest
whom he cited  for assuredly such a thing there was  but whether it
were the ancient athenians that had the glory of the repulse and
resistance of those forces i can say nothing but certain it is
there never came back either ship or man from that voyage  neither
had the other voyage of those of coya upon us had better fortune if
they had not met with enemies of greater clemency  for the king of
this island by name altabin a wise man and a great warrior
knowing well both his own strength and that of his enemies handled
the matter so as he cut off their landforces from their ships and
entoiled both their navy and their tamp with a greater power than
theirs both by sea and land arid compelled them to render themselves
without striking stroke and after they were at his mercy contenting
himself only with their oath that they should no more bear arms
against him dismissed them all in safety

 so as marvel you not at the thin population of america nor at the
rudeness and ignorance of the people for you must account your
inhabitants of america as a young people younger a thousand years at
the least than the rest of the world for that there was so much time
between the universal flood and their particular inundation  for the
poor remnant of human seed which remained in their mountains peopled
the country again slowly by little and little and being simple and
savage people not like noah and his sons which was the chief family
of the earth they were not able to leave letters arts and civility
to their posterity and having likewise in their mountainous
habitations been used in respect of the extreme cold of those
regions to clothe themselves with the skins of tigers bears and
great hairy goats that they have in those parts when after they came
down into the valley and found the intolerable heats which are there
and knew no means of lighter apparel they were forced to begin the
custom of going naked which continueth at this day  only they take
great pride and delight in the feathers of birds and this also they
took from those their ancestors of the mountains who were invited
unto it by the infinite flights of birds that came up to the high
grounds while the waters stood below  so you see by this main
accident of time we lost our traffic with the americans with whom of
all others in regard they lay nearest to us we had most commerce

 there reigned in this land about nineteen hundred years ago a king
whose memory of all others we most adore not superstitiously but as
a divine instrument though a mortal man his name was solamona and
we esteem him as the lawgiver of our nation  this king had a large
heart inscrutable for good and was wholly bent to make his kingdom
and people happy  he therefore taking into consideration how
sufficient and substantive this land was to maintain itself without
any aid at all of the foreigner being five thousand six hundred
miles in circuit and of rare fertility of soil in the greatest part
thereof and finding also the shipping of this country might be
plentifully set on work both by fishing and by transportations from
port to port and likewise by sailing unto some small islands that are
not far from us and are under the crown and laws of this state and
recalling into his memory the happy and flourishing estate wherein
this land then was so as it might be a thousand ways altered to the
worse but scarce any one way to the better thought nothing wanted to
his noble and heroical intentions but only as far as human foresight
might reach to give perpetuity to that which was in his time so
happily established  therefore amongst his other fundamental laws of
this kingdom he did ordain the interdicts and prohibitions which we
have touching entrance of strangers which at that time though it was
after the calamity of america was frequent doubting novelties and
commixture of manners  it is true the like law against the admission
of strangers without licence is an ancient law in the kingdom of china
and yet continued in use  but there it is a poor thing and hath
made them a curious ignorant fearful foolish nation  but our
lawgiver made his law of another temper  for first he hath preserved
all points of humanity in taking order and making provision for the
relief of strangers distressed whereof you have tasted
 that king also still desiring to join humanity and policy together
and thinking it against humanity to detain strangers here against
their wills and against policy that they should return and discover
their knowledge of this estate he took this course he did ordain
that of the strangers that should be permitted to land as many at
all times might depart as would but as many as would stay should
have very good conditions and means to live from the state  wherein
he saw so far that now in so many ages since the prohibition we have
memory not of one ship that ever returned and but of thirteen persons
only at several times that chose to return in our bottoms  what
those few that returned may have reported abroad i know not  but you
must think whatsoever they have said could be taken whore they came
but for a dream  now for our travelling from henna into parts abroad
our lawgiver thought fit altogether to restrain it  so is it not in
china  for the chinese sail where they will or can which sheweth
that their lawn of keeping out strangers is a law of pusillanimity and
fear  but this restraint of ours bath one only exception which is
admirable preserving the good which cometh by communicating with
strangers and avoiding the hurt and i will now open it to you  and
here i shall seem a little to digress but you will by and by find it
pertinent

 but now to come to our present purpose  when the king had forbidden
to all his people navigation into any part that was not under his
crown he made nevertheless this ordinance that every twelve years
there should be set forth out of this kingdom two ships appointed to
several voyages that in either of these ships there should be a
mission of three of the fellows or brethren of salomons house whose
errand was only to give us knowledge of the affairs and state of those
countries to which they were designed and especially of the sciences
arts manufactures and inventions of all the world and withal to
bring unto us books instruments and patterns in every kind that the
ships after they had landed the brethren should return and that the
brethren should stay abroad till the new mission  these ships are not
otherwise fraught than with store of victuals and good quantity of
treasure to remain with the brethren for the buying of such things
and rewarding of such persons as they should think fit  now for me to
tell you how the vulgar sort of mariners are contained from being
discovered at land and how they that must be put on shore for any
time color themselves under the names of other nations and to what
places these voyages have been designed and what places of rendezvous
are appointed for the new missions and the like circumstances of the
practique i may not do it neither is it much to your desire  but
thus you see we maintain a trade not for gold silver or jewels nor
for silks nor for spices nor any other commodity of matter but only
for gods first creature which was light to have light i say of
the growth of all parts of the world
  to kiss the skirt of his tippet but he would not
suffer us and so took his leave  but when it came once amongst our
people that the state used to offer conditions to strangers that would
stay we had work enough to get any of our men to look to our ship
and to keep them from going presently to the governor to crave
conditions  but with much ado we refrained them till we might agree
what course to take

we took ourselves now for free men seeing there was no danger of our
utter perdition and lived most joyfully going abroad and seeing what
was to be seen in the city and places adjacent within our tedder and
obtaining acquaintance with many of the city not of the meanest
quality at whose hands we found such humanity and such a freedom and
desire to take strangers as it were into their bosom as was enough to
make us forget all that was dear to us in our own countries and
continually we met with many things right worthy of observation and
relation as indeed if there be a mirror in the world worthy to hold
mens eyes it is that country

one day there were two of our company bidden to a feast of the family
as they call it  a most natural pious and reverend custom it is
shewing that nation to be compounded of all goodness  this is the
manner of it  it is granted to any man that shall live to see thirty
persons descended of his body alive together and all above three
years old to make this feast which is done at the cost of the state
the father of the family whom they call the tirsan two days before
the feast taketh to him three of such friends as he liketh to choose
and is assisted also by the governor of the city or place where the
feast is celebrated and all the persons of the family of both sexes
are summoned to attend him  these two days the tirsan sitteth in
consultation concerning the good estate of the family  there if
there be any discord or suits between any of the family they are
compounded and appeased  there if any of the family be distressed or
decayed order is taken for their relief and competent means to live
there if any be subject to vice or take ill courses they are
reproved and censured  so likewise direction is given touching
marriages and the courses of life which any of them should take
with divers other the like orders and advices  the governor assisteth
to the end to put in execution by his public authority the decrees
and orders of the tirsan if they should be disobeyed though that
seldom needeth such reverence and obedience they give to the order of
nature  the tirsan doth also then ever choose one man from among his
sons to live in house with him who is called ever after the son of
the vine  the reason will hereafter appear

on the feast day the father or tirsan cometh forth after divine
service into a large room where the feast is celebrated which room
bath an halfpace at the upper end  against the wall in the middle
of the halfpace is a chair placed for him with a table and carpet
before it  over the chair is a state made round or oval and it is
of ivy an ivy somewhat whiter than ours like the leaf of a silver
asp but more shining for it is green all winter  and the state is
curiously wrought with silver and silk of divers colors broiding or
binding in the ivy and is ever of the work of some of the daughters
of the family and veiled over at the top with a fine net of silk and
silver  but the substance of it is true ivy whereof after it is
taken down the friends of the family are desirous to have some leaf
or sprig to keep

the tirsan cometh forth with all his generation or linage the males
before him and the females following him and if there be a mother
from whose body the whole linage is descended there is a traverse
placed in a loft above on the right hand of the chair with a privy
door and a carved window of glass leaded with gold and blue where
she sitteth but is not seen  when the tirsan is come forth he
sitteth down in the chair and all the linage place themselves against
the wall both at his back and upon the return of the halfpace in
order of their years without difference of sex and stand upon their
feet  when he is set the room being always full of company but well
kept and without disorder after some pause there cometh in from the
lower end of the room a taratan which is as much as an herald and
on either side of him two young lads whereof one carrieth a scroll of
their shining yellow parchment and the other a cluster of grapes of
gold with a long foot or stalk  the herald and children are clothed
with mantles of seawater green satin but the heralds mantle is
streamed
 you have reason for to commend that excellent
institution of the feast of the family  and indeed we have experience
that those families that are partakers of the blessing of that feast
do flourish and prosper ever after in an extraordinary manner  but
hear me now and i will tell you what i know  you shall understand
that there is not under the heavens so chaste a nation as this of
bensalem nor so free from all pollution or foulness  it is the
virgin of the world  i remember i have read in one of your european
books of an holy hermit amongst you that desired to see the spirit of
fornication and there appeared to him a little foul ugly aethiop
but if he had desired to see the spirit of chastity of bensalem it
would have appeared to him in the likeness of a fair beautiful
cherubin  for there is nothing amongst mortal men more fair and
admirable than the chaste minds of this people  know therefore that
with them there are no stews no dissolute houses no courtesans nor
anything of that kind  nay they wonder with detestation at you in
europe which permit such things  they say ye have put marriage out
of office for marriage is ordained a remedy for unlawful
concupiscence and natural concupiscence seemeth as a spar to marriage
but when men have at hand a remedy more agreeable to their corrupt
will marriage is almost expulsed  and therefore there are with you
seen infinite men that marry not but chose rather a libertine and
impure single life than to be yoked in marriage and many that do
marry marry late when the prime and strength of their years is past
and when they do marry what is marriage to them but a very bargain
wherein is sought alliance or portion or reputation with some
desire almost indifferent of issue and not the faithful nuptial
union of man and wife that was first instituted  neither is it
possible that those that have cast away so basely so much of their
strength should greatly esteem children being of the same matter
as chaste men do  so likewise during marriage is the case much
amended as it ought to be if those things were tolerated only for
necessity  no but they remain still as a very affront to marriage
the haunting of those dissolute places or resort to courtesans are
no more punished in married men than in bachelors  and the depraved
custom of change and the delight in meretricious embracements where
sin is turned into art maketh marriage a dull thing and a kind of
imposition or tax  they hear you defend these things as done to
avoid greater evils as advoutries deflowering of virgins unnatural
lust and the like  but they say this is a preposterous wisdom and
they call it lots offer who to save his guests from abusing offered
his daughters nay they say farther that there is little gained in
this for that the same vices and appetites do still remain and abound
unlawful lust being like a furnace that if you stop the flames
altogether it will quench but if you give it anyvent it will rage
as for masculine love they have no touch of it and yet there are
not so faithful and inviolate friendships in the world again as are
there and to speak generally as i said before i have not read of
any such chastity in any people as theirs  and their usual saying is
that whosoever is unchaste cannot reverence himself and they say
that the reverence of a mans self is next religion the chiefest
bridle of all vices
 that i would say to him as the
widow of sarepta said to elias that he was come to bring to memory
our sins and that i confess the righteousness of bensalem was greater
than the righteousness of europe
 they have also many wise and excellent laws touching marriage  they
allow no polygamy  they have ordained that none do intermarry or
contract until a month be past from their first interview  marriage
without consent of parents they do not make void but they mulct
 

and as we were thus in conference there came one that seemed to be a
messenger in a rich huke that spake with the jew whereupon he
turned to me and said 
   the next morning he came to me again joyful as it seemed
and said 
   i thanked him and told
him i was most glad of the news

the day being come he made his entry  he was a man of middle stature
and age comely of person and had an aspect as if he pitied men  he
was clothed in a robe of fine black cloth with wide sleeves and a
cape  his under garment was of excellent white linen down to the foot
girt with a girdle of the same and a sindon or tippet of the same
about his neck  he had gloves that were curious` and set with
stone and shoes of peachcoloured velvet  his neck was bare to the
shoulders  his hat was like a helmet or spanish montera and his
locks curled below it decently they were of colour brown  his beard
was cut round and of the same colour with his hair somewhat lighter
he was carried in a rich chariot without wheels litterwise with
two horses at either end richly trapped in blue velvet embroidered
and two footmen on each side in the like attire  the chariot was all
of cedar gilt and adorned with crystal save that the foreend had
panels of sapphires set in borders of gold and the hinderend the
like of emeralds of the peru colour  there was also a sun of gold
radiant upon the top in the midst and on the top before a small
cherub of gold with wings displayed  the chariot was covered with
cloth of gold tissued upon blue  he had before him fifty attendants
young men all in white satin loose coats to the mid leg and
stockings of white silk and shoes of blue velvet and hats of blue
velvet with fine plumes of diverse colours set round like hatbands
next before the chariot went two men bareheaded in linen garments
down the foot girt and shoes of blue velvet who carried the one a
crosier the other a pastoral staff like a sheephook neither of them
of metal but the crosier of balmwood the pastoral staff of cedar
horsemen he had none neither before nor behind his chariot as it
seemeth to avoid all tumult and trouble  behind his chariot went all
the officers and principals of the companies of the city  he sat
alone upon cushions of a kind of excellent plush blue and under his
foot curious carpets of silk of diverse colours like the persian but
far finer  he held up his bare hand as he went as blessing the
people but in silence  the street was wonderfully well kept so that
there was never any army had their men stand in better battlearray
than the people stood  the windows likewise were not crowded but
every one stood in them as if they had been placed

when the shew was past the jew said to me 
   three days after
the jew came to me again and said 
  the pages forth of the room and caused me to sit down beside
him and spake to me thus in the spanish tongue

 the end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes and secret
motions of things and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire to
the effecting of all things possible

 we have burials in several earths where we put diverse cements as
the chineses do their porcellain  but we have them in greater variety
and some of them more fine  we have also great variety of composts
 we have high towers the highest about half a mile in height and
some of them likewise set upon high mountains so that the vantage of
the hill with the tower is in the highest of them three miles at least
and these places we call the upper region accounting the air
between the high places and the low as a middle region  we use these
towers according to their several heights and situations for
insolation refrigeration conservation and for the view of divers
meteors as winds rain snow hail and some of the fiery meteors
also  and upon them in some places are dwellings of hermits whom
we visit sometimes and instruct what to observe

 we have also a number of artificial wells and fountains made in
imitation of the natural sources and baths as tincted upon
 we have also great and spacious houses where we imitate and
demonstrate meteors as snow hail rain some artificial rains of
bodies and not of water thunders lightnings also generations of
bodies in air as frogs flies and divers others

 we have also fair and large baths of several mixtures for the cure
of diseases and the restoring of mans body from arefaction and
others for the confirming of it in strength of sinewes vital parts
and the very juice and substance of the body

 we have also means to make divers plants rise by mixtures of earths
without seeds and likewise to make divers new plants differing from
the vulgar and to make one tree or plant turn into another

 we have also particular pools where we make trials upon fishes as
we have said before of beasts and birds

 i will not hold you long with recounting of our brewhouses
bakehouses and kitchens where are made divers drinks breads and
meats rare and of special effects  wines we have of grapes and
drinks of other juice of fruits of grains and of roots and of
mixtures with honey sugar manna and fruits dried and decocted
also of the tears or woundings of trees and of the pulp of canes
and these drinks are of several ages some to the age or last of forty
years  we have drinks also brewed with several herbs and roots and
spices yea with several fleshes and whitemeats whereof some of the
drinks are such as they are in effect meat and drink both so that
divers especially in age do desire to live with them with little or
no meat or bread  and above all we strive to have drink of extreme
thin parts to insinuate into the body and yet without all biting
sharpness or fretting insomuch as some of them put upon the back of
your hand will with a little stay pass through to the palm and yet
taste mild to the mouth  we have also waters which we ripen in that
fashion as they become nourishing so that they are indeed excellent
drink andmany will use no other  breads we have of several grains
roots and kernels yea and some of flesh and fish dried with divers
kinds of leavenings and seasonings so that some do extremely move
appetites some do nourish so as divers do live of them without any
other meat who live very long  so for meats we have some of them so
beaten and made tender and mortified yet without all corrupting as
a weak heat of the stomach will turn them into good chylus as well as
a strong heat would meat otherwise prepared  we have some meats also
and breads and drinks which taken by men enable them to fast long
after and some other that used make the very flesh of mens bodies
sensibly more hard and tough and their strength far greater than
otherwise it would be

 we have also divers mechanical arts which you have not and stuffs
made by them as papers linen silks tissues dainty works of
feathers of wonderful lustre excellent dies and many others and
shops likewise as well for such as are not brought into vulgar use
amongst us as for those that are  for you must know that of the
things before recited many of them are grown into use throughout the
kingdom but yet if they did flow from our invention we have of them
also for patterns and principals

 we have also perspectivehouses where we make demonstrations of all
lights and radiations and of all colours and out of things
uncoloured and transparent we can represent unto you all several
colours not in rainbows as it is in gems and prisms but of
themselves single  we represent also all multiplications of light
which we carry to great distance and make so sharp as to discern
small points and lines  also all colourations of light all delusions
and deceits of the sight in figures magnitudes motions colours all
demonstrations of shadows  we find also divers means yet unknown to
you of producing of light originally from divers bodies  we procure
means of seeing objects afar off as in the heaven and remote places
and represent things near as afar off and things afar off as near
making feigned distances  we have also helps for the sight far above
spectacles and glasses in use  we have also glasses and means to see
small and minute bodies perfectly and distinctly as the shapes and
colours of small flies and worms grains and flaws in gems which
cannot otherwise be seen observations in urine and blood not
otherwise to be seen  we make artificial rainbows halos and
circles about light  we represent also all manner of reflexions
refractions and multiplications of visual beams of objects

 we have also soundhouses where we practise and demonstrate all
sounds and their generation  we have harmonies which you have not
of quartersounds and lesser slides of sounds  divers instruments of
music likewise to you unknown some sweeter than any you have
together with bells and rings that are dainty and sweet  we represent
small sounds as great and deep likewise great sounds extenuate and
sharp we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds which in
their original are entire  we represent and imitate all articulate
sounds and letters and the voices and notes of beasts and birds  we
have certain helps which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly
we have also divers strange and artificial echoes reflecting the
voice many times and as it were tossing it and some that give back
the voice louder than it came some shriller and some deeper yea
some rendering the voice differing in the letters or articulate sound
from that they receive  we have also means to convey sounds in trunks
and pipes in strange lines and distances

 we have also enginehouses where are prepared engines and
instruments for all sorts of motions  there we imitate and practise
to make swifter motions than any you have either out of your muskets
or any engine that you have and to make them and multiply them more
easily and with small force by wheels and other means and to make
them stronger and more violent than yours are exceeding your greatest
cannons arid basilisks  we represent also ordnance and instruments of
war and engines of all kinds and likewise new mixtures and
compositions of gunpowder wildfires burning in water and
unquenchable  also fireworks of all variety both for pleasure and use
we imitate also flights of birds we have some degrees of flying in
the air  we have ships and boats for going under water and brooking
of seas also swimminggirdles and supporters  we have divers curious
clocks and other like motions of return and some perpetual motions
we imitate also motions of living creatures by images of men beasts
birds fishes and serpents  we have also a great number of other
various motions strange for equality fineness and subtilty

 we have also houses of deceits of the senses where we represent all
manner of feats of juggling false apparitions impostures and
illusions and their fallacies  and surely you will easily believe
that we that have so many things truly natural which induce admiration
could in a world of particulars deceive the senses if we would
disguise those things and labour to make them seem more miraculous
but we do hate all impostures and lies insomuch as we have severely
forbidden it to all our fellows under pain of ignominy and fines
that they do not show any natural work or thing adorned or swelling
but only pure as it is and without all affectation of strangeness

 for the several employments and offices of our fellows we have
twelve that sail into foreign countries under the names of other
nations for our own we conceal who bring us the books and
abstracts and patterns of experiments of all other parts  these we
call merchants of light

 we have three that collect the experiments of all mechanical arts
and also of liberal sciences and also of practices which are not
brought into arts  these we call mysterymen

 we have three that draw the experiments of the former four into
titles and tables to give the better light for the drawing of
observations and axioms out of them  these we call compilers

 then after divers meetings and consults of our whole number to
consider of the former labours and collections we have three that
take care out of them to direct new experiments of a higher light
more penetrating into nature than the former  these we call lamps

 lastly we have three that raise the former discoveries by
experiments into greater observations axioms and aphorisms  these
we call interpreters of nature

 for our ordinances and rites we have two very long and fair
galleries in one of these we place patterns and samples of all manner
of the more rare and excellent inventions in the other we place the
statues of all principal inventors  there we have the statue of your
columbus that discovered the west indies also the inventor of ships
your monk that was the inventor of ordnance and of gunpowder the
inventor of music the inventor of letters the inventor of printing
the inventor of observations of astronomy the inventor of works in
metal the inventor of glass the inventor of silk of the worm the
inventor of wine the inventor of corn and bread the inventor of
sugars and all these by more certain tradition than you have  then
have we divers inventors of our own of excellent works which since
you have not seen it were too long to make descriptions of them and
besides in the right understanding of those descriptions you might
easily err  for upon every invention of value we erect a statue to
the inventor and give him a liberal and honourable reward  these
statues are some of brass some of marble and touchstone some of
cedar and other special woods gilt and adorned some of iron some of
silver some of gold

 lastly we have circuits or visits of divers principal cities of the
kingdom where as it cometh to pass we do publish such new
profitable inventions as we think good  and we do also declare
natural divinations of diseases plagues swarmsof hurtful creatures
scarcity tempests earthquakes great inundations comets
temperature of the year and divers other things and we give counsel
thereupon what the people shall do for the prevention and remedy of
them
 god
bless thee my son and god bless this relation which i have made  i
give thee leave to publish it for the good of other nations for we
here are in gods bosom a land unknown
