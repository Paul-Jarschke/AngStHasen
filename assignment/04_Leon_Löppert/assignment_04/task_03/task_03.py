# Task 03 - Unit Test ----

# The algorithm in decimal2binary_incorrect.py converts numbers in decimal representation to binary.
#
# Develop a unit test that checks for values in the interval [-1,3] whether the algorithm returns the expected results.
# Adjust the algorithm, so it passes the unit test developed in 1). Rename the function to
# decimal_to_binary_correct()


# Correct binary numbers are retrieved from:
# https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html


# Overview:
# - decimal2binary_incorrect.py: contains the possibly wrong function which should be tested
# - testing.py: contains unit tests for the possibly wrong function in the interval [-1,3]

# - decimal2binary_correct.py: contains a corrected version of the function
# - testing2.py: contains unit tests for the corrected function in the interval [-1,3]
