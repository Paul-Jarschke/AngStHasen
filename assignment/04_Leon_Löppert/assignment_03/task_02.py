# Task 02 - Classes ----

# The manager thinks that the simple bookkeeping system you have built is not powerful enough.
# She requests that you start from scratch and use classes instead.

# Write a simple class with appropriate constructor __init__ that initializes an object of class Customer tracking
# the same information as in Task 01.

# Now write two simple methods for class Customer that allow you to deposit and withdraw money for a given customer object.
# Include error messages for inputs that are not permissible, e.g., withdrawing negative amounts or overdrawing the account.
# (Inheritance) Write a child class SavingsCustomer that inherits its features from the parent class Customer.
# A savings customer has an extra savings balance for receiving extra interest.
# The class should have a method to transfer money back and forth between the accounts' main balance as well as the savings balance.
# Do not forget to add reasonable error messages.
